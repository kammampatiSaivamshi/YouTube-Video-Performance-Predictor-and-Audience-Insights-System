"Thanks for this video Ken.

I decided to go into Tech in 2018 by learning web development. Learnt a bit of HTML, CSS and Javascript. My goals has since evolved through this period as I got interested in python programming and Data science.

My current interest now tends towards deep learning and AI

Interesting my knowledge of front end web development will be very helpful in web scraping.",UgxFZTIzC4UPyhhX_PZ4AaABAg,0,0,2022-01-22 08:13:29+00:00,xpIFS6jZbe8,user_981,Positive,2022-01-22

Hey Ken! I am almost finishing my university degreed in market research & marketing and I am going to focus in data science/data engineering. Currently my friends are telling me to buy a M1 Macbook but I am not sure about compatibilities with OSX and I am not familiarised with Macs (I have always being a Windows user).

"So basically is it modest to say that the silver bullet to get into a good role is:
➡️to have had Software Engineer/Development education + experience

Else
➡️to have been submerged  in roles in your current situation (sometimes very unlikely) analyst to scientist
➡️if none of the above, then to get either of the three things (recommended but not required) but without a work portfolio (professional or otherwise) it is intensively hard",UgxdvNxfl4oh9zqJPFh4AaABAg,0,0,2022-01-21 13:40:39+00:00,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_2816,Neutral,2022-01-21

"What I am confused on Data Science and AI with the development of web 3 is, if the data are publicly available- I guess (more like believe) the owner of the data would be kept anonymous. Although there is plenty of data out in the web, how would the business make strategies to reach to their audiences/customers? Wouldn't it be like television/radio/newspaper ads? 
Also, how would the services reach to their probable new customers/audiences? Basically how would AI work for recommendation and how would business collect data to grow their business?

Another great example outside of data science is medical laboratory science.

One of the first examples of Data Science(though it was not called Data Science then) comes from John Snow’s famous map of the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak. Before germ theory was known, it was thought that Cholera was simply in the environment and that it spread at random. John Snow conducted interviews, mapped data points and graphed the results, leading to a single water pump being identified as the culprit. This was founding moment in Epidemiology and Public Health.

"As an accountant I can tell you the reason why you are not seeing any data scientists in small to midsize companies is because they cannot justify the head count.  Sure Amazon can have a whole department for data science but a small business you might be the marketing/finance guy who is also analyzing the other data sets for the company.  The field is not dying, but with tight budgets in small to midsize companies it is hard to justify hiring hiring someone who specializes in data science but cannot do any other core business function.  But that will probably change as time goes on.

Also, as companies grow then the need for data scientists will grow as well.",UgxsOJ5qk4s5gRasRhN4AaABAg,2,1,2022-01-10 05:12:57+00:00,2qVWurPFwfc,user_892,Negative,2022-01-10

"So I took this on two accounts (my main account and my burner account). The one on my main account I took without cheating and I was curious to see how I'd do. I took it almost exactly one year ago today (apparently, I took it on 1/5/21) and I passed and it's on my profile because I got in that top 30%. When I got hired and throughout all of my interviews, it literally never came up. Not once. Nobody was like, ""hey, we noticed this on your profile."" They saw my math undergrad degree, my stats grad degree I was finishing, my research, and work experience.

"Hey Ken! Great video! I haven’t taken the ML assessment, but did take Python and SQL quizzes. Passed both, but I believe companies shouldn’t put significant weight on LinkedIn badges. Specifically, Python and SQL assessments tested very specific knowledge that aren’t necessarily useful to me in my projects. My criticism is based on the assumption that these assessments are designed for testing someone if they are qualified to worked at LinkedIn. With that, it is a great idea if LinkedIn can add a feature for one to display their projects.

I was nervous to take the ML assessment and assumed that, if anything, my first try would just help prepare me for what specifically to study more before retaking (because with only 15 questions, how would ML ""in general"" be covered?)

The vast majority of the questions I got addressed the bias-variance tradeoff... and there were a couple of terminology questions if I remember correctly.

I really like this video as I'm a student transitioning to data science from civil engineering and even their assessments on other software are more so to identify where things are (interface-wise) rather than applications.

"Ultimately the two factors are: the quality of the assessment and how well particular assessments are trusted and utilized by companies.

Google's own assessments might be fine for evaluating potential candidates for themselves or possibly other FAANG (. . . . or should that now be MAANG?) company, but is the level of expectations and requirements the same across the board for any company?

My goal, for this month, is start a small data science project for a local market here where I live. I already have SQL, MySQL, AWS basics and a solid background in maths and stathistics. I think i can do it. If don't, the lesson will be learned. You know.

You are 100% correct Ken. From a this kind of assessment taking there is no value for a data science learner to improve his/her skills and no value for recruiters as well.

To anyone reading this, if you're looking to break into Data Science in 2022 I 100% recommend subscribing to Ken's channel and following his advice!!

Back when COVID-19 started in 2020, I was looking to break into the field and I had no experience, no projects, and I didn't know where to start.

6 MONTHS after subscribing to Ken's channel and soaking in all of his advice through his videos, I got a job as a Data analyst.

Especially your emphasis of building a roadmap and systematically updating it as you grow.

2 not-obvious study habits which I found helpful:
1. I kept multiple projects open so that after I went through a topic (e.g. feature selection), I could implement it in multiple projects.
2. For each topic in my roadmap, I kept a date of when I last implemented the technique in a project.

"""When beginning with this projects, they don't have to be original. You can go through the exact same analysis that someone else did, and still learn something. But typical learning session could just be you having someone else's project on half the screen and you typing it line-by-line and running it on other half of the screen. As you do this you can change the parameters, you can  experiment with different visuals and see how it works as you go.""

This one what i've been thinking for. i feel like i do nothing if i see someone's project and copy it to my notebook, but you just said it and i totally agree. we can experiment it with changing the code, maybe we use a different way to clean the data, or just define a function that others use repeated code, (a.k.a use DRY concept), and so on.

"My first rule of ML Engineering is that you need to spend a lot of time on two sides of Feature Engineering: The input side that creates your state, and the output side that needs to accept it to create that future state. If they would have spend more time in estimating not just the prior stage in the value chain but also the next stage, they might not have ended up in this situation. I.e. if they would have spend as much time to understand the behavior of real estate agents for example, they could have discovered that there are many cases in which they should have created a portal in which only professional real estate agents have access to that database first and can take that estimate as a suggestion and continue the process; revealing how the discrepancies come to be. This way you could get expert input from crucial parts of the value chain in front of you, ride the value chain instead of trying to compete with it. In empirical science people often underestimate the impact of qualitative data compared to quantitative data. And that is exactly what happened here.

"Hey Ken, thanks for touching on some issues which were glaring a problem.

But just to emphasis, flipping a property  to a potential buyer at a current market rate may not have been a ""good"" choice, as
current market value does not include in the renewal cost the company incurred for the house.

You also did mention the model should adjust with a volatile market - VERY TRUE !

but this does not mean Zillow should have sold properties at a lower price, when the market is down to show that real-estate business is still thriving. This could have created a property-bubble.
So their idea just backfired thinking that selling properties could spark more buying ...this market is dynamic on the back of demand and NOT supply.

""Hey the pictures look good of the houses on sale, but I would still go there and see the property myself. ""

As you said in the section ""What is the zestimate really ?""  they should have had professional opinion to get a good grip of what the house-price should be. I think the business model was to eliminate such an intermediary, so that the ""negotiation"" is downed.

Thank you for this video Ken, because I'm an aspiring ML engineer and trying to become a Data Scientist; however I want to use these skills into actual business and this video has given me an insight...

How to succeed in a business using ML/DL as tools that compliments my other skills.  Maybe become a real-estate developer who has Data Science and ML skills and not just a General ML or DS pro.

That article you displayed, ""this will make you understand how hard data science really is"", is trapped by that fallacy: you can only be really really good at something if you know all the stuff about it. That's a very academic mindset and I found that in the real world outside college, it's not what you know, it's how well you can solve problems (aka finish projects). You don't need to know things from the top of your head if you have learned how to find and process information fast.

Right now I'm working on a project that involves integrating data from multiple sources for other people to use, which is very similar to data engineering,  but my goal is to be on the data analysis side and I'm hoping that in the future projects around that will arise. With that being said do you thing that doing this kind of work will pay off in the future, or should I be doing data analysis and data science instead? P.S. I have less than 6 months experience in the field so far.
Thanks!",Ugy8M1kah9wU4-hkbQF4AaABAg,2,3,2021-11-26 13:42:40+00:00,vwvdtXMcNzI,user_1058,Positive,2021-11-26
"By 2030, data science as we know it won't exist.  The demand for DS will be much smaller after transformational automation is complete.   A large percentage of roles will fall back to traditional analytical functions such as accounting and finance and the smaller data science function will be the sole preserve of the Ph.D. who will maintain high salary levels but the rest of the data science fodder will have to look elsewhere for large paydays.    Right now the value that can be delivered by DS is very high but this will become marginal over time so $130K+ starting salaries for DS roles will become a thing of the past for all except the cream of the Ph.D. crop.",UgxHBVrrVkVrKHyTrQh4AaABAg,1,0,2021-11-26 13:37:25+00:00,2qVWurPFwfc,user_2146,Positive,2021-11-26
"I’m fairly new to data engineering, but I’m beginning to notice that there are some segments in Data Engineering approaches to solutions - custom code, implementation of tools, and a hybrid approach each with their own pros and cons.  Custom code can be a good solution when there isn’t an out-of-the-box solution, the job is small, but this can take time.  Prebuilt tools can get problems solved quickly, but may lack some functionality/features and can be expensive.  The hybrid approach seems to be the most useful, but it takes a lot of knowledge to know how, where, and when to make these decisions for a business solution.",UgzU72YhXDnKHI7evcd4AaABAg,1,1,2021-11-26 13:22:55+00:00,vwvdtXMcNzI,user_1722,Positive,2021-11-26

Well as they say, many people just go on for the sophisticated stuff without even clearing the base. I think same is the scenario with data. Many companies joined the data science hype but didn't pay attention to their data or it's architecture.

"When I was 12 years old, I wanted to learn HTML and JavaScript to build my own website that had guitars and penguins on it.

All the so-called ""smart"" ""adults"" around me said that programming was a waste of time because all the programming jobs would get outsourced to other countries anyways and that programming was too hard for people who weren't good at math (like me). Not knowing anything, I decided to listen to them.

Fast forward 4-14 years later, there are self-taught programmers who don't know much math and never went to college, who are now making high 6 figures and I missed that opportunity because I listened too much to other people when I was 12. 

Don't listen to people who aren't experts in the field you are exploring.

"Hi Ken, I'm currently doing a structural biology PhD. The only experience with python/programming I have is through two things: 1) undergrad research where I was doing in silico drug screening against to protein homologs via programs such autodock followed by molecular dynamics. I had to write a few basic python scripts that made the program I was using (YASARA) run and export these simulations over about 20K small molecules per homolog. Things YASARA didn't have built in. That was 4+ years ago (took a job as a technician in a structural biology lab for about 3 years). Finally got into a PhD program but want to move into the computational side (though not entirely giving up wet-lab/experimental structure determination. I'm currently doing my lab rotations and have become more interested in methods. So for cryo-EM and crystallography using computers to help aid in determining structure, which requires ML/DL. On top of that I'm still interested in molecular dynamics of protein-ligan interactions, etc. Which might not be as influenced by data science. Lastly, I had a short course (about half a semester) that introduced R for bio/strucbio data analysis and plotting.

I've been reading a lot of theory (as that's what most professors I'm interested in working with/rotating through seem publish) but still have and am working on my python programming.

Any suggestions for this path? How does one balance graduate school with learning a new skill? The PhD route takes up so much time, how does one learn programming to slightly change projectory within their first year of grad school (to be of interest to comp bio/phys PIs but also so that one has enough experience so that they're not embarrassed or feel like they're holding the research back)?

I am above 50 years old - I have Master degrees in Business Administration and Statistics . I have also done  programming at the initial stage of my career and had been working in the ICT area.

I have worked in the Middle East and India and in the UK for only 1 year after MBA.

"Have you read How Not to Die? That's the book that has had the most profound impact on my life.

You talked about how our gut microbiomes affects the way that we respond to individual foods, but you didn't mention the way that what we eat impacts our gut microbiome. Eating meat adversely affects our gut microbiome, and even our gene expression. While there is plenty of room for individualizing dietary patterns to get people to eat food that they are more compatible with, the broad dietary patterns are clear. Eat minimally processed vegetables, fruit, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and minimize or eliminate your consumption of animal products, refined sugar, refined fat (oil), and processed foods. While the answer of a plant based diet is incomplete, it is at least moving in the right direction, as compared to keto and carnivore diets, which are both associated with increased all cause mortality and environmental destruction. It wouldn't surprise me that meat is worse for some people than others, but I'm extremely skeptical that it's actively good for anyone.

I'll be interested to read what they say in Personalized Diet, but I doubt they can convince me that ice cream is healthy for anyone.",Ugxee5OnTTF5rSeFUJ94AaABAg,1,1,2021-11-14 17:55:21+00:00,35g8fCi-kbw,user_4056,Positive,2021-11-14

2. Never split the difference by Chris Voss who is the former FBI negotiator

"While in general on par with most, I always wonder why people are so sure about what a ""good"" habit is. So in general I think everyone should be make sure about that before jumping to conclusion on how to achieve these ""good"" habits as efficient and fast as possible. Just an example: is efficiency something that is always better than inefficiency.
That's why I highly recommend something like:
Henry Miller - Colossus of Maroussi
Nietzsche - On the Genealogy of Morality
Beauvoir - The Mandarins 
etc.

"Almost forgot: I do have a suggestion of a book in english: It's ""the bullet journal method""  by Ryder Caroll. Most sites who talk about bullet journaling have actually no idea what the method is truly about which is about focusing on important matters in your life and WHY they matter. 

Not having something beautiful or gating people out because ""your stuff is no bullet journal"".
Ie: I do mine using small binders and not a notebook and it works for me but people have told me ""this is not a bullet journal"" and yet it's still a pretty functional bullet journal.

Also, in the same vein of atomic habits, I can recommend Elasitc habits by stephen guise, he's my go to guy when it comes to habit.

Loved your recommendations and have read Atomic Habits myself and am considering to read Digital Minimalism. Well here are some of my recommendations which are about life and I guess psychology: 

1: *Man's search for meaning*- A must read definitely
2: *What Every body speaks* - How to read Body language
3: *Beyond Freedom and Dignity*- BF Skinner classic (an interesting read)
4: Works by *Dostoyevsky* and *Tolstoy* - you know the classics 🐢
5: *So you have been publicly shamed*- Definitely something for the social media world.
6: *Influence: the psychology of persuasion*
7:  *As a man thinketh*

"You make a good case that podcasting can bring you lots of benefits. Similar to blogging. But also similar to blogging for personal gain, is this something we want to be promoting? Shouldn't we only create content that we think might be valuable to others? 
As an example, Medium has some amazing blogs to learn data science, but is also filled to the brim with garbage blogs that where data science beginners show off their skills while only pretending to educate or provide value to others. These blogs waste other people's time, and crowd out the good stuff making it harder to find.

"I’m a seasoned data analyst and can say the following. The big data domain, so that’s data science (aka machine learning), data analytics and business intelligence, are tech fields, but not colourful ones. The focus is business strategy from a data-driven perspective. You do not deliver products as you will not be building or designing applications. You deliver insights, and in time this will have an impact on the business. So no fast/direct impact. Very high-level. You need to like thinking long-term about the business. So no colour, no app building, no designing. It’s all about strategy. You are not a developer; you are a strategist. So if you see yourself doing that, go for it. If you see yourself building or designing, don’t go for it and go for development/designing jobs. Now, there actually is a development type of job in the big data domain: data engineering. But that’s boring and really the data preparation work that nobody wants to do. They just prepare the data for the analysts to analyse. That’s it. I’m sorry for all the data engineers reading this, but it’s the truth and you know it. But hey, if you have a passion for that, go for it what can I say. 

So this sums it up. Good luck 👍🏻",Ugxk6j0HFbF8Jq7fd054AaABAg,0,1,2021-10-23 23:54:12+00:00,sHRq-LshG3U,user_3025,Neutral,2021-10-23

"Communication, man. It is very underestimated. Most of the time, we can achieve much more if we collaborate with others. On the other hand, it requires one to have strong communication skills to manage such a collaborative organization. Unfortunately, people opt out collaborating because they fail to communicate. I am not talking about just talking to each other. I am talking about ""understanding each other"" and willing to solve problems together. 2 years ago, before my PhD oral exam, one wise professor in my PhD committee told me to relax and enjoy the process because no PhD student can be smarter than 5 professors testing you. That was a great advice, and it is very true that we are stronger together IF we can communicate to be a coherent group. 

With that said, I am wondering if there is a video about different ""data"" related roles. I am looking for internships. There are different roles, such as data engineer, data scientist, data analyst, machine learning engineer, AI engineer, etc... I have a broad idea how they differentiate, but I would like to learn more about these roles and their requirements. I quickly skimmed your videos, Ken, but couldn't find a video about it. I mean a video including all these roles, not just comparing data analyst and data scientist. If there is one, can you point me it? If not, it would be great to see a video about that.

"Hi, I am entering into the Data Science world and I have an easy question:

 I am using Sublime Text and not Spider. When I plot my dataframe there (df = pd.read_csv('glassdoor_jobs.csv'; print(df)) I do not get a terminal where I can explore the whole data (like Ken does). Instead what I get is the df cut off. I can explore it by using some commands like "".head(20)/.tail(20)/etc..."" and specifying the columns that I want to be shown, but it's kind of annoying and you may not find some variables that need to be cleaned by doing that.

Does anyone know what could I do to display the whole dataframe outside Sublime Text to explore it?

"I agree with most of the things you said about the algorithms being so good and that it would be very inefficient for your phone to listen constantly to everything. Specifically, it would not be possible for the speech to text to happen constantly on your phone because of intense battery drain. Similarly it would also be impossible to send voice recording constantly over data because you would notice data usage from your provider. 
However, you can clearly see that when you say the keyword e.g. ""Ok google"", or ""hey Siri"" the phone is actually listening. So google could for example implement a list of keywords, that various companies want advertised, and that would also be silently monitored and when they actually find a match in the list, then they could show the ad. In essence they don't actually analyze all the things you say, they just listen for some keywords that they are interested in.",UgzwF8LfdJtVT5AYek14AaABAg,0,2,2021-09-16 20:03:13+00:00,nrEJGGxcoTc,user_4972,Positive,2021-09-16

"Hi Ken Jee, Thanks for sharing so much great info from a personal perspective. I just subscribed to your newsletter but can't leave a comment below a video. Why? Set that way, problem my end, or problem with set-up. So, for your video, A Quick Data Science Project Tip #shorts, I will comment here. Rather than try to make the Iris data set interesting with a good story (same for the Titanic one), why not just choose a more interesting dataset? Kaggle has ones on wine, California wildfires, Covid vaccines, the covid-19 virus, Olympic medals, and so many more. My tip is to take the time to find a compelling dataset for your class assignments / projects. It's better than trying to make up a great use for that boring  iris file. (I did look up ""sepal"" though and learned a lot from class examples.)

1. growth mindset - belief you can improve. overcoming fixed mindset
2. his close friend passed away had him realize that life is short, and he should do something meaningful within short time given to him -> identify your purpose
3. overcoming ""imposter syndrome"" by self-talking with positive words.
4. decide your identity and you will behave according to your identity automatically.
5. just like a game, create proper environment for studying, set a clear goal, give immediate feedback to stay focused
6. practice how to read -> ended up enjoy reading -> helped studying
7. create a simple routine first -> add routines/habit gradually. busy you get, more efficiency in time consuming. 
8. there are vast areas you could study. your time & energy is limited. therefore, narrow it down to specific area you're really interested in, and dig into it.",UgxLUyS2BmuSWolDG294AaABAg,1,4,2021-07-31 15:07:35+00:00,S4Lei5mOppc,user_17,Positive,2021-07-31

"Came for the papaya, stayed for the wisdom and wizardry! 🔥🔥 stream Ken, congrats to you and the community! If you haven’t already definitely read David Goggin’s book (Can’t Hurt Me) and Jesse Itzler’s book where Goggin’s lives with him for 30 days (Living with a Seal), I read them both and went a little H.A.M off the back of it and did an impromptu 65k ultra marathon last year. 

Also, was taking notes all through the stream, and added some of my thoughts:
1. Yes there are a lot of tools out there particularly stuff that will automate and streamline DS and ML workflows. There are however a TONNN of companies which have barely scratched the surface when it comes to DS having an adept captain at the wheel is going to be the difference between them being successful versus not. (18:24)
2. Advice on self studying data science, just get started with something! 100% hands down the best advice, pick something you’re interested in and go for it (32:31)
3. Loved the fact that you both called out developing fundamental skills. Having a strong base allows you to move quickly and stay up to date with innovation in the field (51:50), I’m off to study LDA right now.

"Notes from the video
•API : Application programming interface
•API is basically messenger between two applicants. It recieves a request from the user and we get the response
•It is important for data scientist's because of :-
a) best way to access data. Many websites gives access to data through API
b) reliable and consistent
c) one of the best ways to make your model useful is to turn it into an API
d) saves us time through reusability (leveraging pre built models) 
•How to use an API? 
Find a documentation for an API of your interest and send a request to API
•How to make API?

I'm very much obsessed with A.I sci-fi, and i have one big startup project that i would love to build my self as an side project along the way while I'm studying too.

I have 11 years of experience in marketing, business management, had an marketing agency once did pretty good.

"Thank you for sharing your insights.

I am a working professional in the chemical industry (14 years experience) 
with an applied/pure mathematics degree and am at this point of decision making. I have been accepted into my local accredited university for their Masters of Data Science program. I have also been accepted into GaTech’s Data Science boot camp, and am currently doing the Google Certification to get some bearings.

I really don’t want to wait the 3.5 years it would take to get my masters to enter into this field and would rather start into an entry job at least before I work on my degree, but I also don’t have much of the specific data experience from my current position to get me there.

Do you believe a math degree along with the bootcamp would carry weight? do you know any colleagues that took a similar route? I feel that my math background allows me to be more than capable for the job, but convincing an employer of this without certs or anything else under my belt is a challenge. I am also open to obtaining my Masters while working in data, I’m all about continuing education.

Any opinions and advisement are appreciated.",Ugy74VVSg40roavnif54AaABAg,2,1,2021-06-14 22:02:41+00:00,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_4911,Positive,2021-06-14

"Honestly i don’t know what you are on about... Having worked as a Data Scientist for our government and for the 2nd largest bank of my country (Rabobank) i can say with confidence that a “data scientist” is just a data analist with some data engineering and statistics experience... Mabey not “easy” but far from impossible.

Second point i like to point out is that you should not want to work as a data scientist the rest of your life. You get paid significantly less for your work than for example working as a financial analist or data consultant/manager.. 

Your career path if you want to not get scammed (at least in my country) should be something along the line of: 
- BSc Business Informatics or Information Science
- Work 1-2 year as an IT consultant or Data Engineer
- MSc in Data Science, Econometrics or Statistics/Mathematics
- Work 1 year as a Data scientist at a decent company
- Switch jobs and work as a Financial Analist, Data Manager or IT manager.

"Hi Ken! I am currently finishing my bachelor's degree in Maths of Finance and Risk Management at the University of Michigan. I know umich is kind of a prestigious school, but I got rejected from UCLA, UC Berkeley, NYU, the Ivies, etc. for undergrad. I want to potentially go to one of these schools for my masters in data science. Do you think its a stretch? Umich is way harder than expected, and my CGPA is 3.4 and my major CGPA is 3.06. I feel like my CGPA is way to low to be aiming for these schools so I was wondering what my target schools should be when applying for masters. (I also do not have much experience coding due to my major) Thank you! :)",UgxsSAVW8ror_0rsgiN4AaABAg,2,1,2021-06-06 16:29:48+00:00,RRSRKf9eQxc,user_3305,Positive,2021-06-06

"hello, I would really appreciate an advice on choosing between data science and software engineering.
I studied Economics ad University, but it has never been my passion.

After years of academic studies in the field of Economics I started coding for the first time, in Python.
Since then I developed a true passion for programming.

I currently know Python very well as well as Django to a basic level. I have done several projects with these.
During this path I also had the opportunity to learn Data Science/ML basics.

I am really undecided on which career to pursue.

These are the things I like mostly:
- programming, a lot (this would make me think I more suitable for software engineering)
- using Git and Github
- discovering insights, extracting meanings (this sounds more like data science)
- creativity. I feel I am very creative, and not really a math person.
- languages, both computer and human: I love english (I am not english mother tongue)

I find Data Science fascinating and being a data scientist would surely ""make more sense"" given my background compared to being a software engineering. Also, it requires some skills such as clear communication and presentation skills that I feel I have. However, I fear that data science would not value what I think are (or might become) my strongest skills, creativity and programming, and instead would require me to work more on math on a daily basis. I do not think I would enjoy working with math every day.

"The “Impostor Syndrome” usually refers to the nagging fear of being labeled a fraud for having a job we don’t feel we’re qualified for or receiving an award or recognition that we don’t feel we actually deserve.
A variation should be called the “Average Person Syndrome” for the frustrating feeling of not being “enough”. News and social media frequently show us things like grade school students developing apps or web sites to address some issue of the Covid pandemic, or podcasters, YouTubers and Twitter tech influencers with thousands of followers. This can leave “average” people second guessing their ideas and projects as not being significant “enough” when compared to others on display.",UgwlizzG87Uj0wyiuzV4AaABAg,1,5,2021-05-31 12:49:19+00:00,7JCterBrcvk,user_598,Neutral,2021-05-31

I've always felt overwhelmed when I think about how vast the field of data science is and all that there is to learn and keep up with.

What helped me was understanding that I will not 100% know and understand everything and that is okay, nobody does:)

I don't reckon you're too familiar with many uk univerisites (my bad if i am mistaken) but i have an offer to study data science at warwick, and an offer to study computer science at manchester - the main reason i consider the data science degree is because i like the look of it a lot, but if i keep an interest in coding (though the degree has a lot of options for coding modules within it already), that I won't really be doing myself any wrong picking the data science undergrad over the computer science undergrad?

I'm starting fresh in the DS journey. There's one thing that got me a bit discouraged, and I felt you targeted this issue in one of your videos too:
One of the big reasons I decided to switch to DS is being an International career; I saw myself joining a firm, and later switching jobs, industries, even countries very easily (just like Software Engineers ^^).

However, I sensed that it's not the case with DS? I sensed like if I joined a certain industry as Data Scientist, my skills won't be easily transferable to other industries. For example, you joined the DS world in the sport industry, right? Do you feel your experience is easily transferred to other industries (like automotive, social media, music, retail, etc...).

"In the last two weeks we set up a model registry with mlflow which allows to write model artifacts to the hdfs. We had deploy that in our Kubernetes Cluster and make that work with the hdfs. Volumes, kerberos tickets, different nodes. I even had a feeling of quitting the job because I am too dumb to be honest. In the end, we made it. We have to love the struggle, we don´t get paid well because it´s easy, but because it´s hard. 
Splitting it up really helps, taking a break helps. Good advice in the video :-). Pro tip: To make it really stick, teach a colleague about it or make a youtube video about it. Kinda selfish reasons for a YT channel, but in the end it´s win-win ;-)",UgzMttfQT7YdoLP_KXx4AaABAg,1,3,2021-05-28 13:16:49+00:00,7JCterBrcvk,user_1040,Positive,2021-05-28

"Hey Ken -
I'm considering pulling the trigger on investing in 365 Data Science.  It seems comprehensive and very reasonably priced.  A lot of comm colleges I've looked at don't seem offer too many of these types of courses.  While most of them have Calc 1 - III, they seem to be lacking in other areas (like data structures and stats courses beyond elementary stats).  I realize they are only two year programs.  Any insight regarding which CCs might be offering a more Data Science specific majors at some point in the near future?  Would a comp sci program be of any use?
I have been getting a lot out of working through some of these Kaggle projects.  Honestly, just looking through the comments, code, and how previous projects were built are extremely helpful.  (Your Titantic project example is certainly among them).  
I apologize for bombarding you with these long-winded questions.  I do, however, greatly appreciate the insight you pump out via YouTube. 
 As difficult as this material can be, I do find your words and wisdom inspiring.  It's also nice to see occasional rays of light while sifting through all these reams of data, code, algorithms, and math.  It does spark ideas in my ""not-so-mathematically-inclined"" brain.

"Ken - Thanks a ton for the prompt response!  I figured I'd reply to your message in the new comment field - I've had difficulties posting replies to replies off comments in the past.  It's funny you mentioned a lawyer making the transitioned into the field.  Actually, I know a guy who made a virtually identical transition into a CS/DS related field.  Personally, I don't possess that sort of professional esteem.  I've worked a variety of jobs including tennis teaching pro/coach, commercial painting estimator, warehousing, etc.  Unfortunately, I never earned my Bachelor's.  While I came within range and have taken a series of biz-ad courses at a couple of comm colleges, I can't say that a degree is part of my repertoire.  
With all that being said, do you still think investing in a bootcamp would be the way to go?  Would it perhaps be better for someone with my set of circumstances to at least pursue an Associates in Biz with a concentration in D Analytics?  Indeed includes many Data Analyst positions where at least an Associates is preferred.  I've also read articles stating that holding a Bachelor's is virtually a necessity in terms of getting one's foot in the door as a data analyst.

26ft? You realize if this was the 4point line Steph Curry and Dame Lillard are going to murder the league. Steph is shooting 43.7 percent from 25-29 ft. He is shooting 45.3 percent from 30-35 ft. Dame is shooting 40% from 25-29 ft and 34% from 30-35 ft. Analytically shooting 25% from 4 is equivalant to shooting 50% from 2 point range. If Steph Curry was to shoot 43.7 percent from 4 point range that is equivalent to shooting 87% from 2 point range. If Dame Lillard is shooting 40% from 4 point range that is equivalent to shooting 80% from 2 point range. In context Shaq who was one of the most dominant players ever shot a field goal percentage of 58.2%. So unless you can get wide open dunks on almost every trip down the court dealing with a potential 40% 4 point shooter is not something this league is ready for.,UgxbQDyrnR3_3h1N1H94AaABAg,1,0,2021-05-01 18:56:26+00:00,-kX2b6TF_9k,user_3624,Positive,2021-05-01

Unfortunately, my non-technical background (I'm a liberal arts major who happens to be good at Math) means that I don't have the prerequisite undergraduate courses needed for Masters degrees in Data Science.

However, I fit the profile of some Masters in Business Analytics/Management Analytics degrees. These courses combine business concepts with coding components, with introductory overviews into ML & AI, but they're not deep, technical specializations. Was wondering if you'd say it would be a relatively smooth journey from a Business Analytics Masters degree to an eventual Data Scientist role?",UgwFwXH-loxMPp6cDEh4AaABAg,2,1,2021-04-23 14:33:11+00:00,EMq4PH7PCeA,user_3265,Positive,2021-04-23

"So, I am not making most of the beginner mistakes.  
But I have one question Ken. I don't know enough. Should i see the projects on YouTube and try to implement them by copying and understanding them? And you told about plagiarism in DS.  Will it be like I plagiarized those projects ??",UgwjYk9y0xzZ-TxX2Ed4AaABAg,2,2,2021-04-23 14:29:35+00:00,hOUrxTeBJQc,user_87,Positive,2021-04-23
"I'd personally recommend watching some free videos on a topic on yt before enrolling in a course. This way you can easier choose a good course because you already know what to look for, and since you already know some basics as you watched that free stuff, the material sinks in better because you are repeating it again while watching the course you chose (plus you get a different angle on the topic). 

As you say and I can confirm (from a PhD perspective) ;) getting more then one point of view is important. People have a bias and some things are obvious for one person while difficult for another, the choice of words is very important too. 

Mine main problem is I like theory too much plus I tend to start too many topics at once. I get too impatient and can start NLP topics even though I should be doing e.g. clustering, and NLP is not on the plan for the next few months at least. This has some advantages too (not only bad sides!) - when I get to NLP it's not all new and sinks in better, but me doing that makes the whole process chaotic. Well, I try to pat myself on the back that - in the end - if I fill all the knowledge gaps - it's not that important in what order I did it... 

Still I know I need more order and systematic approach. And more practice. 

Other issue with learning DS, or every new thing really, is that you don't know how long it will take you (coz it's new to you and you don't know it so how can you plan how long it will take if you don't even know what are all the things you must learn... if it makes any sense). So - yeah, don't get crazy about deadlines, just focus on the progress.

Another pro-tip - browse job offers to see what the companies want. I think this may be area and industry specific - in my area they want people good with databases, Hadoop, Spark and other Big data associated things more then they want Deep Learning & AI specialists. 

Kinda makes sense when you think of it... So for me, on my road to Data Science, I decided to go back to my analytics job that will let me practice python&SQL more, get my bills payed ;) and practice the DS stuff in my free time (coz I can already see with the Big data things and me still needing to work on my DL skills more this can easily take another 6 months...) 

So yeah, some comments on Data Science learning from someone who has been learning it for about 6 months ;)",UgwV5kiOvuMLDk6PM6p4AaABAg,2,2,2021-04-23 14:19:49+00:00,hOUrxTeBJQc,user_5252,Positive,2021-04-23

"Hey Ken, have you ever thought on making a video on what is important when you are in a data science role already. Would be quite interesting for me to hear your opinion.

For example I love working with REST Apis and even some Vue Frontend stuff which will not make me a better data scientist, but are also fun...

2) Practical knowledge is very important and I am unable to get that. I have a dataset. I make up problem statements in my mind and try solving it. But that is clearly not helping at all. So can you suggest me some places where I can apply the knowledge of Sql that I gained through the course?

"Just a couple of comments on this excellent video:

For Challenge 4: Actually I'd said find the COMPANIES you'd like to go in order to decide what you want to learn. Try to learn as much as you can from them, and not just their recruitment process. Now, I have yet to find a data science job but I've been around in the job hunting department. There's nothing that puts off an employer more than someone in an interview knowing nothing about the company (I've been there!) ... the reverse is also true, there's nothing more compelling for a prospective employer than an canditate who not just put out the work on their skills but on knowing the company (i've been there too!). It show commitment and the right kind too!

As for the continued learning part, I've learned (duh!) that it something that you need to do constantly for a good life anyways ... no matter what job or hobby you like to do. I probably cited the following quotes a 1000 times in my entourage and probably here too but listen (possibly again):

""We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act but an habit!"". You'll find out that this quote holds true not just for data science but also ... anything really in life really. 

It is also why challenge like #66daysofdata are valuable ... and not just for you professional career but, again ... for anything you want to do really. 

There is a metric tons of things to say about habit formation and, again, I still stand by the methods of stephen guise (which really work well!), but the gist of it is actually quite simple:

work on making your habit sustainable long term before trying to put in massive loads of work. if you do the latter, chances are high you'll burn out (fast!). Do the former, and your brain and body will slowly adjust and adapt to that new habit you're trying to form. 

PS: The variance is quite around the 66 mean to form a new habit. Some can take almost 215 days to form and others can take hold in as little as 12 days!!  (I've been there on both front!) 
But, as they say, your mileage may vary!! 

Safe journey and good luck everyone :o)",UgwG9zapYEaJeXUzncZ4AaABAg,2,1,2021-04-09 21:10:33+00:00,sHRq-LshG3U,user_1105,Positive,2021-04-09
"Thank you for the great video as always Ken. The grit aspect towards the end really speaks to me as someone trying to enter into the field. I remembered when I first started out going into this field my first year at UC Davis, I felt a major hit of imposter syndrome. It all really started out with when I interviewed for a Data Science project for the Data Science club at UC Davis. The president at the time (who interviewed me) asked questions about my project experience, interest in sports (this was a sports analytics project that required computer vision to analyze the movements of players), last book I read, project experience, and my SAT math score. As I answered those questions, he didn't like many answers to any of them (never had projects because I just learned how to code from my Introductory Python course I took the quarter before the interview, not into sports, stupidly said the last book I read was ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" even though it was a book about Robert Kennedy (I was kind of nervous here), and I scored in the 600 range for math) and proceeded to say this, ""Look Jeffrey, I know there's way smarter people than you. Tell me, what makes you stand out?"" My response was, ""Uh... I'm willing to work,"" and he said, ""*sigh* Everyone's willing to work."" I basically failed the interview and he basically implied that this field isn't for me (to add insult to injury, I saw someone do better than me at the interview right after I finished). Not only that, some people thought that I would end up at McDonald's after I graduated. To compensate, I did side projects throughout sophomore year, got accepted into Facebook's Data Science mentorship called the Facebook Data Challenge 2020, secured a summer internship as a Data Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, got accepted into the MURPPS Research Program at UC Davis, and I'm on my way to prepare for an interview for a Bioinformatics Research Position in the Molecular and Cell Biology department at UC Davis to use machine learning models to predict the structure of DNA/RNA to determine how this can lead toward genetic diseases.

"Great advice, Ken. As someone trying to break into the field from a MS Math, I agree the entry level market is oversaturated, though a lot of candidates are unqualified. MSDS programs (which seem to dictate which skills are ""trending"") put emphasis on data viz & ML in Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn) but from what I've seen in job postings, very few data roles use these. Outside of FAANG, where ML operations are critical, most companies need analysts (SQL, Tableau) or SWEs to build pipelines. Creating Jupyter notebooks and applying scikit-learn is a very narrow, high-supply-low-demand skillset. There is a 2020 MIT article suggesting 1 in 10 companies benefited from ML efforts. 

I think it's important to learn skills that are trending once you're in the field, but until then it's better to learn skills that are in high demand (SQL, Tableau, cloud services).  This is what I'm dedicating my time to now.",UgykpuO6YFPCmRWboCh4AaABAg,4,7,2021-04-09 17:31:43+00:00,sHRq-LshG3U,user_4686,Positive,2021-04-09

"Hello, I am struggling to choose a major. I have attained my associate of science transfer degree and need to choose a major. I think I am interested in an information science and data analysis program, but the requirements say you must already have a previous ""skill set"" with python, java, oracle, and linux, or similar to each of those. I am a first gen college student so I am extremely unfamiliar with everything basically. The counselors don't provide any helpful info about specific majors. So, can you tell me, am I supposed to study these on my own, and then apply? Do most people learn on their own, and then apply for majors involving them? I was always under the impression that most people take college courses/gain credits for these but apparently it's wrong? Isn't college for finding what you enjoy too? How would I ever know if I like data analyses and python if I've never taken an actual class on it? Sorry, I just really feel so lost right now.",UgydogGtqoSWhv5pN094AaABAg,1,1,2021-04-02 03:35:29+00:00,4OZip0cgOho,user_2309,Positive,2021-04-02

So Which is a better choice for a person like me. Should I try to apply my skills in games like baseball or Basketball or is it better to go ahead with the games which I played till now?

Ken, thank you for the #66daysofdata challenge, really helped me to evaluate & organize my time, I feel a little bit more confident of my knowledge in DS, now I have more ideas on how to move forward in my projects, I'm grateful for the opportunity to have access to new courses (Udemy & NVIDIA).
I will keep moving forward, and because this initiative has helped that much I will start Round 3 right away, videos will be on this one too but I will be more focused on projects, I will share them for sure!!

"#64: I never had the chance to have time on Fridays or Saturdays for 66 Days of Data, today was my lucky day!
I do like the one that gives insights to make decisions or help the athletes to improve performance.
In the past was difficult to keep track of how an athlete was responding to the training loads, how was sleeping, how was recovering with all the variables that differ from gender to position in the game (or sport). 
It's fascinating to see how some products and the Data Science applied have helped organizations, coaches, and athletes to find the invisible reasons for bad performance or injury :) 
On that, I think that the psychological component it's not being evaluated, which could be a great area to focus too!

Also on paper, I'm on Mathletics, I'm taking notes, I hope to read at least the nine that you recommended!

Yet I can't just decide to study DS at home and not pursue a Master's Degree because I won't qualify for most job offers. At the same time, pursuing Economic Analysis and Modelling is what introduced me to DS .. Although studying free a home would have saved me so much time, money and effort, I'm not sure I'd follow that path if I wasn't already formally stuyding ..

I had a question about data collection. Is data collection supposed to be a one-time process or does it have to be repeated over when the data in the source has changed? Taking the example of glassdoor, the data around salary will change over time, so how do we decide how often we should re-collect the data? And what if the website structure changes so often and hinders the scraping process? For example, this data scrapper code we referenced doesn't work very well if I run it now as many locators have changed, so I would also have to keep up with the changes in the glassdoor web structure.

"Hello!

I am a big fan of your channel and your content helps me learn data science and ML

I am a tennis player and I was thinking on how I could apply data analytics to my game. I did some research and I found a startup called SwingVision that analyses your game using AI.

I thought that I could do something similar mixing my passion of tennis and AI. I have been doing some research but I am not aware of any tool that allows me to do something similar to that. I found some research papers but they had too much math and they were too complex to build my app from that. Are you aware of some framework or any tool that allows me to do something like that? Or do you think that I need to make new algorithms? Also, do you have any tips on how to make it a profitable Saas?

Thank you, ☺️

"I noticed you talked about how a data science major is more watered down than a DS masters, and how majoring in one area of DS could be better. 
I’m currently choosing between majoring in CS at Penn State or data science at Purdue. Do you think the name recognition and internship opportunities at Purdue could outweigh the potential drawbacks, or should I just stick to CS at a less impressive school?

Also, the data science program at Purdue is relatively new, and students say many of the classes are similar to those a CS major takes. The main difference is that CS majors learn software engineering while DS majors learn statistics and data analysis.

"Hey Ken, Thanks for the video. I'm curious as to how the expected score is calculated? A 150 yrd approach shot at the US Open from the rough and the same shot at an average tour event don't have the same expected score. Does SG score these 2 shots as equals?

Another example could be year over year SG stats at the same tournament held at the same course. How are course conditions and weather factored into a players SG score. 

Essentially what I am after is this, are strokes gained calculated in isolation within the same round, tournament, PGA tour Season, or every PGA golf shot ever taken?",UgzAJxiYaHWAV9TL04B4AaABAg,7,1,2021-02-20 04:00:43+00:00,3cDM9Z-fdz4,user_3857,Neutral,2021-02-20

"These are pretty solid tips.  I went through a similar journey since I'm already working and need structured learning. In 2017, I looked at MS CS and MS Data Science programs under $20K that are still decent. What I've seen is Georgia Tech OMSCS ($8,000), Illinois University MS Data science ($21,000), and Indiana University MS Data Science ($21,000).  I failed with my application to Illinois.  I got into OMSCS, I failed my 1st 2 classes and, projected to stay here for a long time. The average class students take is around 1.2 subjects/sem, with a failure rate of about 45%.  I'm finishing up my IU MS Data Science, and hard to find a job still.  What I got is Data Visualization and Management at Ernst and Young (and a lot of my cohorts are still struggling to find work, but easy to get an internship).  If you get into Ga tech OMSCS, it's easier to find job.  OMSCS is data science heavy degree. Subjects include ML, AI, HCI, Computer Vision, ML for Trading, etc.  We even have AI TA's with top-notch teachers and cohorts.",UgwaB8TEfrQ-913hAt14AaABAg,1,2,2021-02-15 01:15:32+00:00,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_3669,Neutral,2021-02-15

"I started learning data science due to the hype created in the market. I forced myself to take interest cuz everyone was doing it. I watched a lot of tutorial, read blogs, made account on kaggle, read research paper on GAN, open ai and list goes on. But still somewhere all this wasn't much appealing and interesting as it was appearing before entering into it. I realized I was not very interested in statistics and probability. And these are the prerequisites to get into this field. So I tried software engineering and got into web development. Today I find it more interesting that data science and I really enjoy the process of building new project and coming up with ur own idea. Unlike data science where u have to spend hours cleaning data and training models. So I recommend everyone to give a try to every field out there, don't follow the herd mentality and explore it, read about it and then decide what's suits you and stick to it.",UgzCcbu8PIgCe3i6qht4AaABAg,10,91,2021-02-15 00:51:39+00:00,SVtRsDhHlDk,user_5631,Positive,2021-02-15

In big five scale in my opinion you're high in openess, low in agreableness, high in concienciousness and probably more introverted. In MBTI scale it would be INTJ type.

"Hi. Thanks for your review, but it seems like unfair to compare Apple 🍎 to orange . Where python is general language with general purpose , unlike R which is a niche programming language otherwise a statistical mathematical language. R is specific that what makes it better than any other language while dealing with analysis. Also R is faster while dealing with large data,  the more the data is big the more is faster. Unlike python which get slower with larger data.

Also the number of contributions and packages is far bigger than python if we compare them in the niche of data science statistics etc..

Visualisation same things while R is the market standard for official productions, I think there is #rstats on Twitter where folks publish there artistic visualisations, also I guess the (TidyTuesday) contest where community provides weekly data for challenges and contributions. 

Machine learning,  users can use R as interface to Tensorflow/keras and pytoch and more, also, a tones of ml packages comes a long to perform complex models.

If you are a developer dealing sometimes with data I suggest you to stay with python . Otherwise data analysts and researchers should pick-up R and stick to it.

"Hi Ken, I have 2 small questions regarding my data science journey. I am at the intermediate level in Data Science and have done a couple of projects and have become quite comfortable tackling beginner/intermediate problems, however I feel that my coding skills are very limited to DS, do you think I should learn new skills (ex; web development), or do you think sticking to DS related coding is enough to get me into the industry? My second question is how deep into the math behind the ML algorithms should I go and understand, especially when it comes to more complicated models (and deep learning models). If my goal is to become a business oriented data scientist (and maybe a sports analyst), Is a basic understanding of the math behind models enough ?

"The last question could be understood as if you were fishing for feedback, hence might indicate lack of confidence or even a lack of understanding to the position you are interviewing for. After all, you have supposedly done your homework and established a strong link between your knowledge, set of skills and the open position, the company's vision, goals, etc. In other words, how would you add value to the company if you still do not understand how your skills and expertise align with their expectations? As an interviewer, I'd view that question in a negative light. But there are ways around it and you can still get that sort of feedback indirectly.

Thanks so much for your videos; I find them really encouraging and instructive.

I am wondering, how does the intuition we build about the data inform how we set up the models?

models and get a prediction with little understanding of the variables ...

"Hi Ken, I am regularly watching your channel now and thanks for lots of great videos. I have recently declared double major on DS. And, my  current fear is that I have encountered lots of data scientists saying that ds requires solid understanding in math. I have already took Calc 1 and 2. However, it was a while ago, so i believe i need to restudy them. And, I still need to take a stats course and linear algebra. So, im currently wondering how strong of math do I need to know if I want to go into the field? Or, how in depth do i need to know of math? For ex, would I need just basic understanding of calculus, stats and linear algebra. Or, do I need to know them solidly by knowing good enough to take “honors” or “higher” courses in that I can implement them however I want and solve bunch of Olympiad level questions? 

Also, would it be okay for me to learn math through online courses or books to acquire skills, or do I need to take courses from a college in order to show that I have taken courses?

I think it is incredibly valuable to see your approach to learning a new Python package - especially to those new to the field that are struggling with imposter syndrome.  Googling and seeing how other people have tackled a problem/project you are working on (and even using some of their code) is perfectly fine and in lots of cases probably the most efficient way of learning a new data analysis method/skill/etc.

So for the first 6 questions (not including the country question) I converted the data types to Categorical and set the order I wanted them within that step. It made it so that the plots I made were in in that order without any additional code in the plotting step.

"Hey Ken.

I currently have 60-90 credits from a bachelor's of arts in business from a state University. I haven't completed a degree and currently have 5 years of experience working IT on government contracts.

Is it recommended that I finish my degree in something on the business side such as finance, learn SQL/python/stats and try to land a BI role?

Or should I go ahead and pursue a science degree such as a bachelor's of science in CS?

"Thank yoy for the very informative videos.
I would add the following advice, which I wish someone had told me: while following courses or reading books in the Data Science learning process, we will be doing tiny projects. There will be a tendency to focus on the learning and not on the packaging of one's work. By packaging I mean: cleaning your code, properly commenting it, basically making it into a notebook you could publish, not into a code that just does the job.

So, there is a tendency to produce drafts for these projects in the learning process, instead of final versions. And the assumption is that at that moment learing is the goal, and that at some later moment we will convert these into final portfolio projects, when we have more time that we can spare and dedicate to the cosmetics part. 

But then you end up a few of months later with a lot of small project drafts to finalize and the task of refactoring and documenting so many projects will seem daunting and you'll keep postponing it. 

Therefore, my advice is: dedicate some time during this learning process to finalizing and publishing your work, resist the temptation of pushing this task further into the future. There won't be a 'right' time.",UgxZtoGdbi8FUB8YBtF4AaABAg,1,2,2021-01-09 15:07:54+00:00,yukdXV9LR48,user_2909,Neutral,2021-01-09

Generally, going from fewer skills to more skills is desirable, but going from ""fat"" aka something negative to ""skinny"" aka an admirable goal...just isn't universal, and it can be unhelpful to present it as such. A more constructive way to present this example could be about taking care of one's health, whatever that looks like for different people.

I happen to know coding, but I've done no programming projects in this program.

"Hello Ken! Thanks for the content!

I recently moved from Brazil to Saint Charles (about 1h from Chicago) so as to stay with my wife and thought that pursuing a masters, instead of only self learning, could give me an edge when looking for a job here. I graduated in Industrial Engineering and am pursuing a masters in data science, preferably in the Chicago area.

Is pursuing a masters a good idea given that I do not currently have a diploma that local employers would recognize?
How much does the prestige of the university matter for professional outcome?
What is, in your opinion, best for professional outcome? An online but more prestigious degree or an on site but less prestigious degree? In Brazil there is prejudice against online learning.
What are your thoughts on University of Illinois at Chicago and Illinois Institute of Technology in general, but also regarding their Business Analytics and Data Science masters ?
Given that I have what I believe could be considered a ""technical background"" what do you believe would be important in a masters in data science? Hard or soft skills?
How was your experience at DePaul? Quality of classes and professional outcome wise.

Sorry for this avalanche of questions. Hope you can answer them as I believe it would be of great help. Thank you!",UgwnI2z8B3mS0JBSkrV4AaABAg,1,1,2021-01-04 19:23:05+00:00,domVw8isGOI,user_2635,Positive,2021-01-04
"My biggest hurtle seems to be the degree.  TL;DR - Due to the Department of Veteran Affairs, I effectively can no longer get a Bachelor’s in the U.S. (without first having tens of thousands, and at that point I could transfer my first 109 credits), so I’ve been learning a lot of the math on the side.  Programming I’ve been doing since I was a child, but I’ve still a lot to learn to become a data scientist in other aspects.  Anyone who may know, I’m intrigued, in your experience, approximately what percentage of data scientists do you know who hold no degree?  I imagine not a lot.  But then again, I’d finish my degree if I could, too.  🤷🏻‍♂️",Ugy3vZxNKixvvIhq4zp4AaABAg,1,1,2021-01-04 17:33:08+00:00,3Mm1U1CbzNw,user_4447,Positive,2021-01-04

"Reviewing the processing code that others have written has exposed a significant issue. Whether the original dataset is already in a ""sanitized"" state or in need of cleaning, reorganization, or transformation a lot of the existing ""notebooks"" show there is little to no evidence of getting to know and understand the data before these examples jump to the exploratory data analysis stage. This boils down to blindly accepting the dataset without question. Is the data accurate? What is the source of the underlying data?


Perhaps an over reliance on so-called curated or well-known datasets is the underlying cause of this phenomenon. Some people, including instructors, claim the exploratory data analysis stage is when you learn about the dataset. In my opinion and based on experience, the exploratory data analysis stage is supposed to be time evaluate whether the data is suitable for the particular question(s) that instigated the project. Prior to EDA is the time to understand the raw data itself but not whether it can potentially answer those questions. The rush to model building exposes another serious deficiency in the way data science of taught - is the goal of the project to explain historical data or predict future outcomes when presented with new data - is the data skewed or is it relatively normally distributed or should the data be normalized or weighted - is  a model necessary? 


The curated datasets have a place in learning data science. However, too often they instill lemming-like cookie-cutter behaviour. Use these datasets to learn a concept but avoid making them part of a portfolio or treating them as a best practise for real projects. If you want to use them to document your data science learning journey that is fine but at least be creative in the way such datasets are presented - consider demonstrating how a seemingly obvious but incorrect/inappropriate machine learning technique can lead to useless, if not erroneous, conclusions and/or models, and state the reason(s) this technique is inappropriate; consider something other than Python and R to process the data, maybe SQL is adequate; consider integrating other data sources so what-if scenarios can be performed, ideally interactively by end-users. For example, what if data about iceberg flows and the route of the HMS Titanic were added to the model, could the collision have been avoided while still reaching New York City in record time? This might require simulated data based on historical data or modelled using knowledge of ocean currents, fluid dynamics, iceberg and ice fields formation and physical characteristics, weather conditions, etc.

Think critically about the data and what if anything it can teach us. Ask the difficult questions and attempt to answer them.",Ugw5pWtNBiaVcQokThV4AaABAg,0,1,2021-01-01 11:43:07+00:00,-pdXWmj9xxU,user_1704,Positive,2021-01-01

"Hi Ken. I just opened up my course work for my master's program in Data Science from the University of Denver and I am on red alert! The bridge math courses are so intense that I feel like I may be in over my head. The calculus bridge course essentially covers calculus from limits all the way up to multivariate calculus and beyond (4 to 5 calculus courses) in a span of 10 weeks! Their discrete math and linear algebra combine these two disciplines as well. I may switch to Eastern University's program which is much less math intensive and can be completed in 10 months. Do you think companies will really care where I get my degree from? I enjoy math, but not at such a pace that I will have difficulty retaining any of it. The fact that I end up spending over 95% of my time using outside resources to even begin to understand how to do the homework assignments leads me to believe this may not be a very well structured program and that I might as well drop this master's program and switch to a different one.",Ugz6yfy1BjJ_em_oADx4AaABAg,1,1,2020-12-29 18:23:59+00:00,41Clrh6nv1s,user_1243,Positive,2020-12-29
"I'm interested in shifting my career to ""Data Science"" & I need an advice from an expert in the field after watching good amount of your Youtube videos.


I moved to Illinois, Chicago 7 months ago from Jordan. I've been in the Marketing field for over 5 years & I decided this isn't the field that I wish to continue perusing.

Since a lot of companies require Master's degree as a minimum requirement for a Data Scientist position. I conducted MSc programs search that would have low entry requirements considering that I come from Business major, and  I came across ""Eastern University"" Data Science Accelerated (7 Weeks) Online MSc, which I applied to & waiting a response from the admission office.

I compared the curriculum to other universities, & I noticed that Cloud Computing & Algorithms are not covered.

My Question:
If I proceed with this low entry barrier University (If Accepted) considering my lack of technical knowledge coming from a Business Major (Learning Python & SQL on my own)
- Will I be able to land a job after finishing the program? since the university isn't well recognized or hiring relies on sharpened skills?
- Does the curriculum cover the needed practical knowledge on the job?
- What are the areas/topics that you see important and are not listed in the curriculum?

Below are the information of the program, if you could spare 15 minutes of your time to give me a candid opinion.

"Before delving into machine learning I recommend aspiring data scientists hone data cleaning and exploratory data analysis skills. Data familiarization and cleaning being foundational skills. There are smallish datasets that are appropriate for beginners and which can be visually scanned to confirm the findings reported. For example, the automobile fuel efficiency dataset available from UCI contains 'marked' missing values for some numeric data, data entry mistakes primarily in the make and/or model; not every make and model combination is present more than one year, and two fuel types are present. The data source makes available the original dataset as well as a subset still requiring further cleaning, along with a codebook describing the data and each variable. Many instructors tell you to begin by plotting the data but this approach has two problems: you do not know if there are any missing values or other incorrect values which can lead to plots which are erroneous or simply cannot be rendered; and you have not spent sufficient time understanding the raw data and the types of questions it might be able to answer.",UgxKyDHnDOyoUacXvxd4AaABAg,2,44,2020-12-22 23:47:35+00:00,8igH8qZafpo,user_1704,Positive,2020-12-22

"Took me a while to write the comment, sorry. I've been busy with Christmas preparations (sending virtual Polish Christmas pierogi to Hawaii ;) ). 

My new year's resolutions are a bit similar - I want to get more engaged in communities and find new friends. Also - maybe eventually appear on your YT Channel as a successful transition to DS story ;) 

I have many ideas for DS projects, but they all need some more research (some including IP & compliance research - hey, I used to work as something like a ISO/FDA compliance officer for a while, I kinda like this stuff? I certainly don't mind it... I found some courses on Coursera about those topics... I am not ruling out taking those courses in 2021.

1) Start with a plan. That's what I need to do now. I've been jumping around too much.

"Sorry but your definition is totally misleading because Artificial Intelligence is not a field of data science neither machine learning but machine learning is a subset of AI and AI is a subset Computer Science. It has been so since 1956 and has never changed. People who develop AI algorithms are computer scientists not data scientists. 

Just like Mathematics is not a subset of Physics, yes Data Scientists use lot of ML to solve problems but they do not generally study AI like computer scientist do. Just like physicists uses math but they do not study math like mathematicians do. You can also say so about medical professionals when comparing them to biologists.

I really have been absorbing and enjoying your videos for the past 3 months. Having a physics background and a secret fear of programming, your clear philosophical approach has been a lifesaver. 
I thoroughly enjoy the weekly interviews on KNN and the separate, visual content your youtube channel has to offer. It's so cool to track your growth!

"Great advice and content Ken! One thing I would love to add to those seeking their first job is to ignore job titles, and be open to positions such as ""BI Analyst/Engineer, Data Analyst, etc"", especially if you are entry level for several reasons  1) I was a BI associate and had opportunities to work on ML. Companies use terms interchangeably, and I have seen ""data scientists"" who do SQL and reporting all day.. 2)  If you want to be a data scientist, you'll have to work with analysts, BI people, data engineers, and stepping into their shoes will help you in the long run. In a way it's taking 1 step back to take 3 forward.  and 3) People should really focus on bringing value to an organization, rather than just doing ""cool"" projects. A lot of companies aren't ready for advanced ML/AI. You will be more miserable creating a data science project which will never be put into production than creating a Tableau Dashboard that the whole business will use.

"you said and i agree :first start with learn programming
at what point do u stop and say ok i ''''know''''' programming ?
so for me i decided that when i am able to solve 6 kyu question on codewars and easy questions on leetcode without any problem and only then can i say without feeling that i lie that kind of know enough python to go on
granted it takes a lot of time and pain but im pretty sure it will be worth it because then i can be sure that comes hell or high water i will never have a problem that is caused bcoz of insufficient knowledge in programming 
anybody here share my viewpoint?
am i too much?to little?",UgwnzuhBXV1GPmZshvR4AaABAg,1,1,2020-12-19 17:44:01+00:00,41Clrh6nv1s,user_1202,Positive,2020-12-19

"There is so much free and good source out there about data science and so many ways to learn it... As someone just starting their data science journey and someone who is struggling with ADHD I was so overwhelmed and confused. If anyone is in my situation I've found ""Siraj Raval - Learn Data Science in 3 Months"" video helpful. You are not going to be a data scientist in 3 months obviously, but I think it is giving you a rough plan. It is divided into weeks and each month you do one project. Of course, I also check the resources Ken suggested and I am following a Python course on Udemy, so it is ok to mix all of the advice you see. One more advice:  you can better learn a subject when you teach it. So I recommend you start a blog about your DS journey. You can take 10 mins each day and write about what you learned that day. It is also good for you to see how much you've learned over time :) Good luck everyone!",UgwwvMt3BNvxmQjDEKB4AaABAg,1,1,2020-12-19 14:41:37+00:00,41Clrh6nv1s,user_5255,Positive,2020-12-19

I started the 66 data journey with you but wasn't able to keep up, but you always motivate me, hope to be more sincere this time.

Maybe starting with Kaggle and online courses..
So many different courses, competition, everything gets me so overwhelmed, maybe because I just look through it instead of starting, but not this time, I will make use of time!

"Hello,
I am from India and i am currently in class 12th. Now i have this very big doubt on weather i should take B.Tec in CSE or AI. I want to persue my career in AI and i will doing till PhD. What my parents thinks that i should take CSE for B.Tec, coz if i don't like AI then i would not be left with more options, and what my side is, that i just love AI, like i literally love it. So nowaday there are some colleges which offer a B.Tec course in AI. So i have compared the curriculums of Both AI and CSE and what i found is if yoh are clear that you want to do AI then definitely you should take AI in B.Tec. So i have this confusion of what to do in my B.Tec, can you please help me through this. It would be really a great help to me. My only consern is that if i take CSE then the topics like ML, AI, digital fabrication, AI and Humanity, DBMS, Computer networks, robotics, etc. I will miss this all as strong base, as direct in master i will be having less time, if i opt for AI then i have a preety good amount of time, and other side it's a wide spectrum open to me if i take CSE, so this is what my prospective is so what should i choose?",UgxOD8rELxZZ2aBNtQp4AaABAg,2,0,2020-12-12 06:11:50+00:00,ji7DtgUeKCI,user_2425,Positive,2020-12-12

"Hello,
I am from India and i am currently in class 12th. Now i have this very big doubt on weather i should take B.Tec in CSE or AI. I want to persue my career in AI and i will doing till PhD. What my parents thinks that i should take CSE for B.Tec, coz if i don't like AI then i would not be left with more options, and what my side is, that i just love AI, like i literally love it. So nowaday there are some colleges which offer a B.Tec course in AI. So i have compared the curriculums of Both AI and CSE and what i found is if yoh are clear that you want to do AI then definitely you should take AI in B.Tec. So i have this confusion of what to do in my B.Tec, can you please help me through this. It would be really a great help to me. 
My only consern is that if i take CSE then the topics like ML, AI, digital fabrication, AI and Humanity, DBMS, Computer networks, robotics, etc. I will miss this all as strong base, as direct in master i will be having less time, if i opt for AI then i have a preety good amount of time, and other side it's a wide spectrum open to me if i take CSE, so this is what my prospective is so what should i choose?",UgxX0seHykGyoxGgB7V4AaABAg,2,1,2020-12-10 14:57:59+00:00,yukdXV9LR48,user_2425,Positive,2020-12-10

"When you say probability theory, what level are we talking about? Like the ""probability theory"" class at my school is calculus based and requires us to have taken Multivariable calculus beforehand. Meanwhile I know a lot of concepts in probability theory can be taught to some extent without difficult calculus problems. For example, I just recently ordered a textbook: Probability for the enthusiastic beginner by David J. Morin. It doesn't assume any prior experience with calculus. It covers Combinatorics, Probability, Expectation Values, Distributions, Gaussian Approximations, Correlation, and Regression.

In case it's helpful for anyone: I'm in Oregon State University's Data Analysis Program and was doing Sales (groan) before. You can either cash out halfway through for a Certificate (for about $12k) or go full Master's (for about $25k). I'm about halfway through. I tried the Udemy and self-learning approach and an actual school is totally worth the money in my eyes. The use cases you work with are more compelling and rigorously assessed than free / cheap stuff I found online. You're also bombarded with concepts each week which gives you a lot of bang for your buck; usually I learn just enough to pass the class then really try to internalize it via independent projects after. I'm planning on a more portfolio-based entryway into a position that recoups what I paid for school and whether my anecdotal advice is even worth listening to probably hinges on how successful that ends up being ;o) but thus far I have been very happy with academic learning (and I'm not someone who likes college!),Ugxrup3_8rICjHToWjF4AaABAg,1,3,2020-12-06 01:26:25+00:00,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_1888,Positive,2020-12-06

What did you do for the glassdoor project (data scraping wise) if you don't mind me asking? If I understand things correctly, if the robots.txt forbids you from scraping them, you use their API and all is cool?

Great content as usual
May I have some recommendations or suggestions from you?
I'm in my graduate study on modeling fish population dynamics. The situation is that I know about one field, working with data and models in this particular area but I wanna make myself a bit more employable post graduation. Therefore, I start looking up about data science, and realize there are some part of data science work I already do (I just don't know it's called data science out there lol). However, there are some part I haven't touched yet (e.g. computer vision, random forest, and neural network). 
Should I do machine learning and deep learning courses to organize my knowledge? 
I deeply understand that nobody can cover all the topics. It's just not happening. What I expect is to be well-prepared for job.

Prepared for math remediation; calculus, ODE, LinAlg, PDE and basic prob/stat  augmented with R & Py. Can you suggest a roadmap or decision-tree representation for stats classwork beyond Intro to Stats/Prob. and which texts work best for the practitioner?

I'm doing research now that my professor plans to get published, but it took a lot of work to get to this spot. I don't know of any other master's student in my program doing research. Tina's right that generally, those opportunities are only available for undergrads and PhD students. I want to do an independent study in reinforcement learning to close out my last semester (next semester) but I already know that since I'm not a PhD student or curious undergrad, the chances of me getting that opportunity are slim to none. I'm hopeful that instead I might just continue to do research under the professor I'm currently working with.

Currently doing my M.Sc. in Data Science with the university of London. I'm also working full-time and I will honestly not recommend anyone doing the program full-time while working full-time if you aren't already working in data science or have a strong base in the field. I'm in 4 classes this semester, and while I have a strong math background and comfortable programming in python, my programming skills are not the greatest and I am new to the Data Science field.

"Hi Ken, while watching this video, I just realized that I'm now part of one data science community. Wow, thank you for bringing us all together! I'm looking forward to more of your videos about Kaggle projects. 

Lately, I found one very useful extension of jupyter notebook, TOC2, which automatically creates a table of contents with hyperlinks based on the headings. Its link: https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/toc2/README.html. Once you try it, I bet you will love it.

However, it's not available in Kaggle yet. The closest thing it has is to display the first level headings on the right in the reading mode. There's large room for improvement.

Louis posted in product feedback on Kaggle six months ago (https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/153519), but received little attention. What a pity! Can you help draw more attention and upvote it? If you have any other ideas, please let me know. I strongly believe that getting our sharing notebook well organized and more readable is very helpful for the community. TOC2 will make it much easier.",UgyNMuS3Nk8tQ6UwFKh4AaABAg,0,0,2020-11-20 05:56:07+00:00,78LjdAAw0wA,user_841,Positive,2020-11-20

However, I've noticed that there are a lot of MS CS and MS DS majors who apply for these majors. Do you think I should change my major to match those or do you think I should remain in the track that I am.

"I joined the initiative and lasted maybe 10 days... This year has been really rough, but I've always had a problem finding the motivation to self-teach. My personal lesson that I learned was to take the ""5 mins a day"" to heart. My flawed plan at the beginning was to spend 2-3 hours everyday watching recordings of a bootcamp course I took to refresh my memory on coding, then dive into projects. I got burnt out super fast, and part of that was because I wanted to match the impressive strides I saw so many people making on Discord. I'll definitely pace myself better next time and not be stingy and actually buy an online course. And I'll definitely be looking forward to joining in at the beginning of next year for the next initiative, with all of these improvements in mind!",UgxI1kdgPP4ijOWmaYJ4AaABAg,1,2,2020-11-13 15:46:23+00:00,4039x4r-hGE,user_5177,Positive,2020-11-13

"Oh man! What an excellent and beautiful video! I have learned so much these past few months, become so much better, it blows my mind. And it wasn't just Machine learning either. That being said, being part of the #66daysofdata community has certainly been a very large contributor to this, so many thanks for the opportunity ! :)

And one thing that I found that helps for ... practically everything is something that I learned while watching a very old movie named the ""Silent Flute"".
The script was originally written by none other than Bruce Lee who died before he could shoot it. It was taken over and the 'master' was played by none other than David Carradine. And despite showing its old age,  it's full of wisdoms! 

One of them in particular struck a major cord inside me when David Carradine, playing the master who, according to his student, ""seemed to know everything"" he simply answered with this:

""Every time the sun rises, like the student on their first day of school, I open a blank page in my mind to write the lesson of the day."" ... After which, I wrote this on a blank page and added ""... and have an actual, real blank page ready to write the lesson on it.""

I started this on the 14th of may and ... well ... still doing this every-single-day. It's incredible how much you can learn about ... everything when doing this little exercise and I certainly do like to mention Machine Learning here and there. Like, say, pointing out the importance of iterations in practically everything you can do and learn in life. 

Or use lessons I learned from something else, say art, and apply them to my Machine Learning studies -> The kind that says sometimes it's good to switch to something different. not only does it allows you to go back later with a fresh mind but, even better, for all you know, the other project you'll be working might give you ideas for the first one. 

Just watching this video is bringing back to memory some of the stuff that I have written in this 'book of wisdom' of mine and makes me want to say so many things about it that I won't do it. This post is already getting very long as it is, sorry for the wall of text.  ( come to think of it, I need to write one on how to try to summarize my point of views much more briefly).

"You're really starting to get the hang of this YouTube(r) business down! The editing is looking great with the different camera angles and transitions and stuff. Have you considered streaming on Twitch or YouTube for some extra views/content? Resume reviews, portfolio reviews, interview advice/practice, teaching something, etc? I know you put out that course a while ago. Good content in the video by the way. I've been using Kaggle to learn some proper ML techniques and their implementations along with when/how to use them,  and also get acquainted with Python more since I'm an such an R junkie. Playing with some stock data sets on there has been good for me, but I do agree, value or good business value comes from gathering some original data or doing something with some impact. 

I'm currently thinking about trying to build a special app/thingy (currently thinking an RShiny web app) that scrapes data/information on Yugioh's card collecting/valuation website and then so someone can enter what cards they have and how much (ignoring PSA value) and then it'll autopopulate the current valuation cell next to it or something. One small note, and I hope this doesn't come across as offensive, but I personally thought that the camera angle/cutaway/transition at around @6:45 was a bit awkward, as it looked like you were speaking but there was an audio lag or something. Very well could just be something due to my internet, but it took me out a little bit if you know what I mean. Nonetheless though, great video and great content.

"In my opinion, you should stick to the field you are interested in. And data should be complicated enough to be worth analyzing, not like two columns. But to get both the data and the idea is the biggest problem for me so far. I either have the idea, but it's nearly impossible to find any decent amount of data or there would be lots of data, but on a topic that I've never found the least exciting. Sometimes data isn't complicated enough for a project. For instance, I do monitor used cars sales on a regular basis, I just love reading about cars, comparing them. But the tricky thing is, there are like 5 or 6 variables to utilize, like mileage, color, horsepower, year produced etc. It's more than enough for eda, but there is not much room for machine learning project.

Hi Kenji. Is there a trade-off between projects that are personally interesting vs portfoilo-worthy projects?

"Another question, if we have the funds to pay for a Data Science degree at say Maryville University on line but it is not a masters do you feel that is okay? The other option is for my son to finish his current B.A. in PHHP at the University of Florida and move forward to the Post Baccalaureate degree to get the additional credits needed. He would then move on to the B.A. in  C.S. and finish that degree. One is longer and a Public University the other is Private, but I belive  he can obtain what he needs in Maryville. This is the trade off and frankly he hates the PHHP bachelor's and has 3 more semesters and I would like him to just move on. One is more time, One is more money.

My roadmap is in a paper I presented last September in Durban, SA - just as motivation to keep me at it. I’m a cybersecurity analyst and acquired my master’s degree in Linguistics at UGA in 2017.

"Hi, great video, some tips for the reader from what I learned from work: 
1. I recommend to start including git in every project you do, I didn’t do that, but I wish i did. It helps like ken said with version control, and easier changes publishing instead of going online and going through a whole process, and also ur gonna use it at work for sure so might as well practice.
2. He’s using GitBash, idk if it was mentioned and I missed it but that’s the command line interface to use git. It’s also good cause it uses Bash so if u know Linux/Ubuntu it’s be easier to use. I use the same but there are others if you don’t want to start with a command line like VsCode, Atom, GitHub Desktop (although I recommend Bash). 
3. use Git Status pretty much after every command because If ur in ur own branch, and want to switch to another one, all your work will be lost if not committed or stashed first. 
(Git Stash is just what it sounds like, temporarily stashed or saves your changes to the side so u can do other work and then Pop later).",UgwTSYNgmCTE_t0h9yx4AaABAg,1,2,2020-10-24 12:45:53+00:00,_0rHU6qAQe0,user_3664,Positive,2020-10-24

"""We fail more then we success""  - so Data Science is like real Science... In Academia you only have high success to failure rate at low levels. Once you get to new and complex things it can get hard. Really hard. And depressing. Of course you can always be that lucky one and get your experiment parameters right in first go. ;) 

I used to be what a lot of people would think of as a ""real scientist"" (the one that does experiments in a lab coat, in a lab to discover and create new things). A lot of things in Academia is presented as if the success was effortless, nobody is showing the amount of work that went into it, results from failed experiments rarely get published if at all.

One of my friends also has imposter syndrome (I have different issues ;) I am always hungry for knowledge and new things and I love solving problems; also I'm unemployed atm so I can't have an imposter syndrome)...

As for failures - this is a normal part of the process. I don't remember who said it, but it went like this: when you enter the a new uncharted territory, when you try new things nobody did before, everybody is underqualified for the job. I think this is a huge part of what being a Scientist is - you try to do new things, and you fail, and you learn from it and you try again. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Some problems can't get solved at this stage - maybe new tools, theories, new data need to appear first. Sometimes it is too expensive to do what is needed to get a good solution, maybe an approximation can be good enough? I'd like to say that this is why you get paid the big bucks - because it requires certain way of thinking, intelligence and skills to solve problems. To be a Scientist it ain't an easy job in general. Sadly a lot of Scientists are really poorly payed. And a lot of research is conducted in a very bad, unproductive way, but that's an off-topic.

The job hunt - IMO it is a bit of lottery. And just because someone has amazing credentials doesn't necessarily mean they are amazing themselves. I've worked with people that had PhDs from an university ranked in world's top 25, one of these people came even from a VERY VERY good research group... and they were not living up to the standard I imagined. The best Scientists I worked with came from UK (university outside the country's top 10) and India. Of course good credentials do help you to get a job. That's why you should get them. But also get the understanding of the things you are doing and the knowledge of the subject. A PhD diploma is a proof a person wrote and defended a PhD, it does not make someone a good Scientist. Maybe it should, but these are two different things.

I also heard words of wisdom that went like these: don't compare yourself to other people, you don't know their full story. Compare the you of yesterday to the you of today.

I'm off with that - this comment is getting too long. Good video Ken :)",UgwM0jjh6kHvyYrF7bh4AaABAg,2,4,2020-10-16 19:53:58+00:00,Uf0dO-pgOrk,user_5252,Positive,2020-10-16

letterly this is what I feel almost in every competitive environment I engage in. Some times I have objective evidence that I am worse than most people  like in sport when no one picks me to play in their team. And sometimes in the contrary I think I'm bad but when I see other people's performance I know that I'm not. I think that is because we fail to something called survivorship bias. Most of the people that we see are successful since successful people have more popularity so the sample of people that we are comparing ourselves with is not random.,UgxiQZxHmgRnpVCKp6R4AaABAg,1,1,2020-10-16 18:00:01+00:00,Uf0dO-pgOrk,user_5840,Positive,2020-10-16

"I really liked how he talked about learning to like this feeling. I think a physical training metaphor here is really apt. When you work out it hurts and is uncomfortable as you train muscles you may not be using very often. One thing many people who work out regularly talk about is how good they feel afterwards, even though their body is in pain. Similarly whenever you learn something it hurts, almost phyically. You can feel your mind straining to try and understand whatever abstract concept your reading about. For some reason we are surpised by this. ""Shouldn't this be easier?"", ""How does anyone understand this"", or ""The guy in the video I watch made it seem like this was easy to understand"". of course we do not see how long they had to sturggle to actually understand the concept. If we go in with the expectiation, this going to hurt but I love that feeling of brain ache after a good reading I think it can help with those feelings a lot. The other issue is time, the feeling that you need to become competent in a short ammount of time sucks.

"Hi ken, loved the content you have been putting out regarding DS, I have some doubts regarding my situation since its quite specific and I wanted to get your opinion.

I was going to start my undergrad as an Engineer in Data and Mathematics but I have decided to wait one more year so that I can study in Germany (I live in Mexico so returning here with with a German title will allow me to secure a job with ease). In the mean time I have been considering possibly switching majors to something like Economics, or Physics. I have thought of becoming a DS for two years now, however I am worried that the Job opportunities DS promises might shrink and that my degree might limit me the amount of jobs I can find in comparison to the other degrees I am interested in. I am not the best at coding however I have been told that as long as I know how to properly query with SQL (which I can) and have a good exposition of my data, I should be fine. Although I know I would enjoy my time studying something like Economics I feel like it would be really easy for me and I would only want to get in degree in something I struggle with so that I have a more complete profile when I enter the corporate world.

TLDR: I really enjoy the implications of being a DS and want a challenging major, but I don't know if Im cut out to be one and might consider just doing a Masters after an undegrad in something else.",Ugw12KDJ1My-8T0vPHF4AaABAg,1,2,2020-10-16 02:52:09+00:00,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_295,Positive,2020-10-16

I've worked in the manufacturing industry for over 10 years. I strongly believe that AI and big data analysis will bring our industry to a brighter future. Though I'm still struggling in picking up the data science skills, I hope to bring awareness of AI power to more people from the manufacturing industry. That's why I started my sharing of AI, big data analysis, the driven power behind IT industry, 5G, block chain. The highest number of views are 100~200, still far away from those popular posts which got thousands of views. I'm not discouraged because I know what I'm doing and why I'm doing it.

"Hey Ken! Thanks for another great video.
I have a question about projects on resumes. I am struggling to think of ways to quantify the purpose of projects beyond just the results of different machine learning models. Because the results are not really put to use after finding them, there is no real quantitative impact to put on the resume (such as a 10% increase in sales).  Is it necessary or suggested to have this for your projects? If so, what ways might you go about restructuring/expanding upon data science projects to address their possible ""lack of usability"" ?",UgyderoK41ksMKJQ1954AaABAg,1,2,2020-10-14 06:09:27+00:00,1Ir1NgCuI0Y,user_5522,Positive,2020-10-14

I've got a physics work background with no degree. I'm looking to go back to school for a masters in physics in mind, but interested in combined/joint degree options. I'm leaning towards mathematics, but with the priority of CS towards Data Science, I might consider the later. Would a bootcamp be enough as long as I do my own projects and networking to keep DS an option, or would you strongly recommend the Phys/CS joint degree over the combined phys/math -> masters -> bootcamp option.

"Agreed, there is no replacement for real world projects.   When tutorials are designed, they will always come to a successful model with good results and will usually have the data nicely prepared for you.  That's exactly opposite of the real world.  You may work on a project for weeks and conclude there is no signal in the data at least in its current form, or you may work weeks on just preparing data or learning enough domain knowledge to understand the data.  That said tutorials and class learning are great to learn the workflow and structure of analysis. As you said you will be constantly going back and forth between direct coding and learning new methods to tackle new problems.  I would say if you have an idea of the domain you will be working in, you should focus your efforts on the models and concepts relevant to that domain.  There isn't a whole lot of similarity between analyzing mass scientific tabular data and computer vision.",Ugx-1m56ldMonejk9Fh4AaABAg,1,1,2020-10-11 14:27:06+00:00,4OZip0cgOho,user_2559,Positive,2020-10-11

Great video! You should have mentioned RShiny/Shiny apps in your second (third?) bullet point though! But I'm heavily partial/biased towards R haha. Great vid. I like the idea of doing a project involving web scraping. The one thing that can be frustrating about being in grad school for stats is all of our data sets are already cleaned for us. We just get it and most of the time it's all good to go so we can just worry about doing whatever statistics we need to do on it. Scraping data sounds like a good way to get some nice raw data that would require some cleaning and then running some cool analytics on after some EDA.

"Hey Ken, your down-to-basics and straightforward approach to the explaining data science and learning it are very confidence-inspiring to someone trying to get into the field. I have a background somewhat in statistics in that I graduated with an undergrad in psychology but with a focus on statistics. I did 3 quantitative and 1 qualitative study in undergrad and I think I have some chance of using that to my advantage. I'm working currently to pay the bills and keep needs like health insurance available and I'm currently starting the self-study method. I've binged through a few videos and I'm going to try ""ultralearning"" data science, but I'm really not sure where to go from there. I'm going to try to build a good portfolio but I feel like if I just try to say"" I have a degree in psych buut it's with a focus on psych stats"" and then get just a cert or a bootcamp then it won't be worth it for anybody looking to hire. Getting a masters is always on the table but like you said that's a big time and money commitment for no guarantee of a career out of the gate. In the end I think the connections of a bootcamp are more beneficial for me but I also don't want to shell out cash to find out that method would not make me look as good on a resume compared to a degree program.

You know what I hate about modern day sports analytics? You got all these terms that never existed like 10 or so years ago in sports with strange names that are hard to figure out what they even mean. Yet people continuously write articles referencing them as if the average sports fan already knows what all these are and they're self explanatory even though they clearly aren't and it's fancy jargon that you have no clue what it could possibly mean. Like I was reading an article talking about Breonna Stewarts win shares in her WNBA career. Nowhere in the article did it explain what win shares mean. Obviously it has to do with wins. But beyond that I have no clue. Then there is this other one that has defense or defensive in the title I can remember the full name of the stat but it's a really strange name. It's mentioned all the time as if it's common sense to what it means and we should already know. Lol. Nobody ever explains these things as if they're normal stats.

"Hey Ken, I am in the process of changing my major from a B.S. in Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) to Data Science as the ROI (Return on Investment) is sub par in SLP and I have discovered many interesting facets associated with Data Science. I have to take some prereqs before I can apply to my university's B.S. in Data Science program. However, I became concerned as you mentioned that Data Science COULD become oversaturated even if I have a Master's degree (SLP is too since they'll take anyone ranging from pre-med to Underwater Basket Weaving). Will I keep a high-paying job if I make this transition now and have a few years of experience after earning a grad degree, or should I do the following: 1) B.S. in Data Science with Actuarial Science Minor 2) B.A. or B.S. in Stats with a Minor in Computer Science 3) Pick something in tech, business, econ/finance, or another field. After learning from the recent pandemic and reevaluating my college career, I have surmised that I want to do a tech, math, computer, business, or finance/econ-based job from home.

"Hi Ken, tell me what you think of my idea.
Given my age and current educational background and the fact that we are in a pandemic and many companies are probably mitigating risks in regards to hiring, trying to find myself an entry-level data analyst job will probably be next to impossible. I have decided that I am going to be starting a master's program this fall. I am deciding on Colorado State University Global's AI and Machine Learning master's degree or going with Eastern University's Master's in Data Science. Eastern's  program is brand new, so it probably does not have many reviews yet. It seem like it is a program for all ability levels, so I'm not sure of the robustness of the program. I am thinking of going for a double master's in this field. I could go the PhD route if I'm going to have a master's already by the end of next year, but I do not feel like setting myself back several tens of thousands of dollars more in debt for doctorate school. I figure the job market is not going to get any where near normal until at least 2023. With so many people out of work and looking for new jobs, I feel it is going to get super competitive. With the rock bottom tuition for some of these programs helping to minimize student loan debt, I might as well use this time to rack up a master's degree or two in this field.",UgxGf4S_CP7uGxdpFEd4AaABAg,1,1,2020-10-07 01:06:57+00:00,UpaEjBOMNqs,user_1243,Positive,2020-10-07

"Ive worked in Data Science for three years now. When you go to that interview my best advice is to be studied up and give good examples of practical experience. It is quite rewarding I went from 58k starting now at 72K three years I pay 0 dollars and 0 cents for health care that is a Cadillac Plan I get 10 sick days a year and 3 weeks Vacation Time. I do not pay for food when I am at work they cater in meals. Heres some personal advice to prepare yourself. Kick all bullshit people and situations out of your life. This includes All Social Media you need to focus and be prepared. You need to really be strong in systems and troubleshooting skills of those systems. DO NOT TAKE YOUR PHONE IN THE INTERVIEW. TAKE A NOTEPAD AND HAVE YOUR OWN PEN SUGGEST A FISHER SPACE PEN IT WILL WRITE AND NOT MAKE YOU BE IN A PEN BEGGING SITUATION>. My interview was five people that you need to convince you are worth a shit.  I do remember a remarkable moment in the interview where I was asked about Social Media I stated that I had closed all my Social Media Years prior. 

These systems are complex and use many inter relationship application features to communicate data  to one another. You need to be able to show this understanding. You need to be able to find and isolate issues in that system. You need to be able to answer questions about particular data points and features. This is not for everybody. I'm just going to lay it all out here if you fuck off at  work and arent truly focused dont apply. If you are the type of person who just wants a check who thinks showing up is good enough dont apply. This is why they have so many people at the interviews for these jobs. They are trying to see if you have what it takes and are disciplined. I used number four applied with in the company. Yes they paid for the training after selection. By the way the criteria was stiff 90% weighted grades required or you would be let go. There was 19 people in the class 15 made it.

When I was hired 5 people were hired at the same time 4 of those have been fired. Theres good money to be made here if you show you are serious they will keep raising your pay. Reasons for firing one was on FaceBook all the time. One was a Narcissitic Drama Queen. One had tons of excuses for not completing Tasks. One got fired for Sexual Harrassment.

I was a very happy Data Analyst when COVID Crisis hit (the industry was aviation so yeah...). I also have some experience with six sigma, lean manufacturing and production as well.

What would you advise a person like me? 

I was thinking about getting a bunch of certificates - those offered by deeplearning.ai on Coursera seem to be ok (as opposed to IBM Data Science course - this one sucks), also Coursera has several courses organized by Google, AWS, Mongo DB, etc that seem interesting, as they prove presence of some practical skills in real industry used tools. 

What do you think is the better option - bootcamp or a collection of certificates? I leaning towards collection of certificates - this means I don't have to go through the basics of Python programming again, and in the price of the bootcamp (say 2500 usd) I can get some interesting collection of new skill certificates or deepen those I feel need deepening.",Ugzdpqcg1vLgmFCMQmp4AaABAg,2,1,2020-10-02 18:19:15+00:00,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_5252,Positive,2020-10-02
"How Much Math do I need in Data Science?
Math skills are essential in data science and machine learning
 
I. Introduction

If you are a data science aspirant, you no doubt have the following questions in mind:

Can I become a data scientist with little or no math background?

What essential math skills are important in data science?

There are so many good packages that can be used for building predictive models or for producing data visualizations. Some of the most common packages for descriptive and predictive analytics include:

    Ggplot2
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
    Scikit-learn
    Caret
    TensorFlow
    PyTorch
    Keras

Thanks to these packages, anyone can build a model or produce a data visualization. However, very solid background knowledge in mathematics is essential for fine-tuning your models to produce reliable models with optimal performance. It is one thing to build a model, it is another thing to interpret the model and draw out meaningful conclusions that can be used for data-driven decision making. It’s important that before using these packages, you have an understanding of the mathematical basis of each, that way you are not using these packages simply as black-box tools.
II. Case Study: Building A Multiple Regression Model

Let’s suppose we are going to be building a multi-regression model. Before doing that, we need to ask ourselves the following questions:

How big is my dataset?

What are my feature variables and target variable?

What predictor features correlate the most with the target variable?

What features are important?

Should I scale my features?

How should my dataset be partitioned into training and testing sets?

What is principal component analysis (PCA)?

Should I use PCA for removing redundant features?

How do I evaluate my model? Should I used R2 score, MSE, or MAE?

How can I improve the predictive power of the model?

Should I use regularized regression models?

What are the regression coefficients?

What is the intercept?

Should I use non-parametric regression models such as KNeighbors regression or support vector regression?

What are the hyperparameters in my model, and how can they be fine-tuned to obtain the model with optimal performance?

Without a sound math background, you wouldn’t be able to address the questions raised above. The bottom line is that in data science and machine learning, mathematical skills are as important as programming skills. As a data science aspirant, it is therefore essential that you invest time to study the theoretical and mathematical foundations of data science and machine learning. Your ability to build reliable and efficient models that can be applied to real-world problems depends on how good your mathematical skills are. To see how math skills are applied in building a machine learning regression model, please see this article: Machine Learning Process Tutorial.

Let’s now discuss some of the essential math skills needed in data science and machine learning.
III. Essential Math Skills for Data Science and Machine Learning
1. Statistics and Probability

Statistics and Probability is used for visualization of features, data preprocessing, feature transformation, data imputation, dimensionality reduction, feature engineering, model evaluation, etc.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Mean, Median, Mode, Standard deviation/variance, Correlation coefficient and the covariance matrix, Probability distributions (Binomial, Poisson, Normal), p-value, Baye’s Theorem (Precision, Recall, Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve), Central Limit Theorem, R_2 score, Mean Square Error (MSE), A/B Testing, Monte Carlo Simulation
2. Multivariable Calculus

Most machine learning models are built with a dataset having several features or predictors. Hence, familiarity with multivariable calculus is extremely important for building a machine learning model.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Functions of several variables; Derivatives and gradients; Step function, Sigmoid function, Logit function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function; Cost function; Plotting of functions; Minimum and Maximum values of a function
3. Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is the most important math skill in machine learning. A data set is represented as a matrix. Linear algebra is used in data preprocessing, data transformation, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Vectors; Norm of a vector; Matrices; Transpose of a matrix; The inverse of a matrix; The determinant of a matrix; Trace of a Matrix; Dot product; Eigenvalues; Eigenvectors
4. Optimization Methods

Most machine learning algorithms perform predictive modeling by minimizing an objective function, thereby learning the weights that must be applied to the testing data in order to obtain the predicted labels.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Cost function/Objective function; Likelihood function; Error function; Gradient Descent Algorithm and its variants (e.g. Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm)
IV. Summary and Conclusion

In summary, we’ve discussed the essential math and theoretical skills that are needed in data science and machine learning. There are several free online courses that will teach you the necessary math skills that you need in data science and machine learning. As a data science aspirant, it’s important to keep in mind that the theoretical foundations of data science are very crucial for building efficient and reliable models. You should, therefore, invest enough time to study the mathematical theory behind each machine learning algorithm.",Ugzochg_g7ApIOrmjvF4AaABAg,0,2,2020-10-02 17:54:31+00:00,UpaEjBOMNqs,user_1784,Positive,2020-10-02

As a basketball fan and a data science enthusiast I loved this video. I would be very interested to see how something  like that (moving the 3 point line back) would effect the way defensive schemes are designed and how it would change the game as a whole. I have also talked to people in the past about the idea of simply removing those corner threes and having the arc be 23.75 feet all the way to the sidelines.

I was doing a bunch of research on turning one of my models into a productionized web app and I was trying to decide between AWS and Heroku. Heroku is definitely way easier and way more hands off but would it look better from a hiring managers perspective if I took the time to learn some devops and fired up an AWS instance with my model running on it?

"Hey Ken, regarding getting a Masters Degree, I am confused on which to pursue (MS Data Science, MS Stats and Data Science, MS Information Technology). I want to get into a Data Science career path but I am worried that Data Science would be a fad and I would be struggling to land jobs upon graduation. Most of the job descriptions for a data scientist I encountered requires MS in Computer Science, Statistics, etc",UgxYY4SMpVn1EnVVYn14AaABAg,1,0,2020-09-27 03:37:13+00:00,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_5786,Neutral,2020-09-27

"Hi Ken,  Many thanks for your interesting and insightful sharing! I 'm from China, and have been following you on youtube. I worked for 3 Fortune-500 companies (European, American) in different roles (research, application, marketing) in the manufacturing industry in the past ten years. I like learning and  taking challenges.
My current challege is to redirect my career development into data science field to keep up with intelligent era. I hope to master the big-data-analysis skill and apply it to the digital transformation of manufacturing industry. I started learning machine learning and data analysis respectively 2~3 years ago, and took several on-line courses on Udacity, Coursera, DataCamp. I'm major in material science and engineering, much different from CS , mathematcs or statistics. There's so much to pick up! Everytime I feel like learning more, I soon found out much more to learn. It's quite overwhelming...
Your sharing helped me know better about the world of data science. As you advised, I'm now working on the Kaggle competition. Even though, the course I took before had several projects based on the Kaggle datasets and competition, it's my first time to participate in on my own. Besides, this week, I started uploading my work to github and Kaggle to build up my profile.",UgywzupDeMH_uO4GMfp4AaABAg,2,1,2020-09-26 08:01:00+00:00,Kq9dkZu0bpg,user_841,Positive,2020-09-26

"Hi Ken. Just found your channel recently and it’s been an amazing resource for me. I’m new to data science and as a former athlete, I’m hoping to work in sports analytics eventually. However I have a background working in product creation in the apparel industry for 10 years. Based on what you’ve said a few times, it seems my best path is working in data science in apparel before transitioning into sports? If I wanted to start building my portfolio, would it be weird to have projects in both categories? Should I only show apparel projects now and do sports for fun?

I found this https://orysyastus.github.io/ github pages website and I really like the way this person has everything laid out and I was just gonna fork it and put my own information and my own projects on it. 

But does that look bad to a future employer? Like I was too lazy to create my own portfolio from scratch? And the other thing I worry about it is what if like 5,000 other people all had the same idea as me and then my portfolio page looks identical to other people that all forked from this same github page lol.

"I applied in hopes that I could get mentorship when it comes to looking for an entry-level data analyst job. All I got was it said I am a bit too early and should brush up on my fundamentals. My goal is to someday be a data scientist, but I realize that is going to take me several months if not years to obtain such role, and have since been solely focusing on acquiring enough skills to land an entry-level data analyst job. I was unable to get assistance from the VA to pursue a master's in data science degree, so now I am left to my own defenses in learning these skills on my own. I have been using Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for nearly a year now.  I have completed a handful of data analyst projects and posted them on GitHub. I have over a year with using SQL. I am now taking a Coursera course on Tableau and working on an Oracle Database Administrator certification course. How much longer will it take for me to land an entry-level data analyst job?

Sorry but SharpestMinds is not operating in India. We have a lot of MOOC's available and it becomes confusing in which one to take. To be practical or theory. 
Especially I get confused like when I take up theory I tend to take theory as I do not understand the things used and why and when doing theory I tend that I am lacking the practical. I end up really end doing absolute nothing.
I really am looking for such a thing and would really help not only for me but all of the aspirants in India. Please may it available for enthusiast like us .Please can you make it available in India.

Project A - Kaggle: 
- finish top 10% in a Kaggle competition and write a blog post outlining each step of the process and explaining my thought process of why I chose certain algorithms and my understanding of certain concepts 

Project B - solve a cool problem or answer a question with data science: 
-Pull data from an API database to get experience with SQL or collect my own data source through scraping 
-Clean the data 
-Do some advanced feature engineering with the data 
-Do some testing on different models to figure out which one performs the best 
-Create a website and put the end model into production 
-write a blog post about the project and its results

Hi Ken. I was recently made redundant and decided to take advantage of the chance to return to the type of work that makes me happy (problem solving). I decided to learn Python and became very interested in data analysis and data science. A few weeks in I found your channel and that is when I really found direction. Thanks. I did have one quick question that I cannot find covered elsewhere in your videos. I like all your advice on CV and LinkedIn information but what would you put as your current  job title in my situation (paid for several months but not actually working for an employer). Thanks again for your amazing guidance.,Ugyh4ybTa42wTGFb1yl4AaABAg,2,1,2020-09-21 07:22:26+00:00,uXLnbdHMf8w,user_1156,Positive,2020-09-21
"Hey Ken, amazing video - I always appreciate your material. I’m currently working in a fairly big bank as a data analyst, the job doesn’t require the use of very strong programs, excel and Adobe at best. Before I started this job I wasn’t 100% on going into DS but now that I am, would you say it’d be a good move to do a master’s in DS to try and move into more pure blooded data scientist roles? Or is it realistically possible to do that by self teaching with the help of kaggle etc? for context, I have a solid BSc in Maths/Stats so I’ve had a little exposure to R and Python.

"A question here, Ken:
As a beginner, I'm going through lots of books and tutorials to comprehend the concepts of each algorithm and how to apply them, basically using them in a project.
Many of the suggested projects for newbies have been done and posted by thousands of people, including bootcamp projects. Even if I do everything on my own thoroughly, it's still the same dataset, project, and approach. I'm wondering if it's ok to add them to my portfolio, at least until I do a little more advanced projects.",Ugz-l9Rf2EsdIMfw8tB4AaABAg,1,1,2020-09-19 06:42:51+00:00,apf6A3Nstm8,user_2860,Positive,2020-09-19

Hello ken. I am a full stack developer and high school student in 12 grade. I have a sound knowledge in this field. I want to be a data scientist. And in front of me there are two options. One is: Go to college and take computer science then learn data science . 2nd one is : Don't go to college and do self study and projects and take some online certificates as data scientist and machine learning engineer and I am ready to give the efforts .But I am kind of confused . Sometime I think I should do self study and real life projects but It also concern be whether it will be a good decision not to go to college. Can you kindly give a advice which will be better because you have a masters degree in computer science.

"Hi Ken, thanks a lot for these informative videos.. For a beginner, to whom this video is intended, how many weeks would it take to complete these 3 preliminary projects? Lets say, if one were to devote a couple of hours every day to work on these ( 2 hours is an guesstimate because at this preliminary stage, most learners are balancing full time job or education ).. I ask this, because I want to follow the path but not have unrealistic expectations and beat myself.. at the same time, I would like to know what a reasonable timeframe for completion would be..",UgwoeKBJxQc6HyB2Yxp4AaABAg,2,1,2020-09-13 10:08:35+00:00,8igH8qZafpo,user_5201,Positive,2020-09-13

"""Narrowing the scope of things I am trying to learn"" is great advise...another great video !

I learned this the hard way after spending months jumping on to follow every tutorial related to data science I could find on youtube - statistics, data analysis, data visualization, deep learning...etc. It was very overwhelming and didn't do much for my confidence as a beginner.

"It is awesome and very motivating to see how you evolved so drastically!
Thank you a lot for sharing this;
about three years ago I also was mostly unproductive and did not get a lot of stuff done.
I have been continually trying to make small improvements and I have gotten a long way (but I still have an even longer way to go, of course!)

I really paused for a moment when you talked about the aspect of focus. I have been guilty in the past of trying to do 20 different things at the same time and as a result I have experienced dissatisfaction with the outcomes. I will try to narrow my goals down in the future and only focus on one (or very few) different things at a time.

When you said, that you don't think you have come far, I wanted to add one detail. I don't remember exactly where I have this ""way of thinking"" from, but it was very inspiring to me.
Even if you (as in ""you"" personally) do not feel that you have achieved ""that"" much, it can be motivating to think of people as a network in general. When someone focuses on their own success, they might see that they have done ""average"" or ""somewhat well"", but maybe their actions have affected someone else. And that person affects someone else (else). So while I know the feeling of always trying to achieve more and always wanting to be as successful as possible, I can definitely say that through your channel you have reached a lot of people. And maybe you have influenced 1% or 5% or even more of those people to do something. And maybe those 5% have influenced their own 5% and so on. 
I know for a fact that you have influenced me for the better and motivated me to start actively trying 66daysofdata and becoming more interested in habit building. So I wanted to say thank you, from me, and for everyone else you influenced at least a little bit. You're awesome! :)",UgzE2QT3VZIdeBME-bx4AaABAg,3,1,2020-09-11 18:55:47+00:00,jf3j0lWmFPU,user_830,Positive,2020-09-11

"I swear some of the things you said reminded of some of the books you mention:

1. the importance of habits and 2. identity -> Those two go hand in hand together and, one best way to describe oneself is by what we do on a consistant basis. Hence if you can chance your habits, you can chance your identity. 
The growth mindset has been cited in many different book tough I have ""7 habits of highly successful people"". 

Motivation clearly sucks as a base strategy, since it's volatile. Don't get me wrong, it's good to have sometimes, but view it rather as a very good friend who has MANY friends, always willing to help, giving a lot of it when it can ... but who can't really always be there on account of having so many people to help .... Motivation is VERY popular these days if you catch my meaning ;)

Another thing about identity and accounting, and something I've talked about before, is to give yourself proof of what you've accomplished so far and what you are doing right now ... and a bullet journal, for this and feedback (since ppl won't always be there to give it to you) ... this is perfect for this. Make sure to add the proper tracker to it.

And when you feel one of those tracker, that's what Ken Jee here said about about fist pumping and being proud of yourself ... yep, it's very to do that with a tracker and a bullet journal. I can't tell you how many ""YES!!"" I've shouted when marking one ;)

"Hi Ken. I'm looking to transition into data science over the course of the next year or two if possible. I have around 8 years experience in digital media, so there is somewhat of a narrative of ""data analysis"" that I can build on - though that analysis was limited to digital media analytics platforms. The job has given me an edge in terms of communication, presentation-building, etc., but that's where my advantages end. My undergrad is in a non-quantitative major (sport management). I have zero calculus at this time. I spent the first 3 years of my career in sales. And I cannot afford to take an internship at any point throughout the remainder of my career.

I'm currently taking the Data Analysis nanodegree program with Udacity, and getting a really good handle on the analytics toolkit. The programming is coming easier than I expected. From there I was thinking of self-studying the math, and doing the Udacity Data Science nanodegree to start to get the DS foundation. I think I have a reasonable shot of moving into the analytics department at my current agency within the next year. I can start to build a DS portfolio around that time as well. 

With that context - do you suggest I go masters, boot camp, certificate, or continued self-study after that?",UgxxhooQMt-kUl7iuWF4AaABAg,1,2,2020-09-06 16:56:55+00:00,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_4333,Positive,2020-09-06

"This video was great!

I have found some frustration from ""not understanding a topic"" but not looking for a different explanation. For example, I struggled to understand what a p-value is and how it is useful; to understand what the p-value was, I found a statistics textbook and read about it. I still didn't understand and felt doomed to never understand p-values. Using your approach of looking for more resources, I was able to get a better understanding of it! It is a great idea to see a topic explained in different ways and by different sources. Thank you for bringing this technique up!

"I am just a beginner and not an expert, but I think beginners should take the first notebook(by Pedro Marcelino) with a pinch of salt. There are some things I found very wrong in this notebook:

1. You don't always need to drop multicollinear variables. 1 most widely used model in Kaggle is XGBoost and it is immune to multicollinearity. I think, so are other random forest like models.
2. Dropping a variable because it has more than 15% missing data is a bad idea. This threshold is too much in my humble opinion.

There are more things which much more experience Data Scientists have pointed out in comments section.

"Great video Ken! Learning from other people's code is a great way to learn. Another great way to learn for me is code reviewing where for example some of my colleague or students would send over their code as a Jupyter notebook where I would go over the code, figure out how the ML model workflow could be improved, could be faster, could add some areas of novelty, etc. such that the resulting research paper would have a chance for publication in a scientific journal. Afterwards, I would have discussion with the person who wrote the code and together we can learn from one another on the rationale for choosing a specific approach and whether some component could be adjusted to provide better performance, new areas of novelty, etc. 
On another note, Amazing video editing (pattern interrupts 😃), also noticed that you're using Notion as placeholders for the code, great tips!

"Hi! I am new to Data Science. I have a Civil Engineering Degree and a MBA. I also understand how to develop algorithms with my knowledge in C and C++ (unfortunately this was over 10 yrs ago), I have maintained the knowledge to develop algorithms, not so much the language. I was taught to visual the problem and find what are constants and what will be the variables. I had also used Matlab in college to write a code to solve triple integrals...which was far easier to do than solving it by hand. I also understand statistics and have  13 years of engineering experience. I have decided to start with learning Python. I am going the self taught method.

Also it would be great if you answer comments at the end of the video, given that there are relevant questions of course. I think that would put even more information into your already very informative videos!
Speaking of questions: Here's one:
So I watched your Udemy course and how you talked about reaching out to recruiters or just in general experienced people and how you should try to schedule a call within a specific timeframe. You also said it's always a good idea to try and give ""something back"", so to offer to the other person some sort of help. My question would be, what type of help can someone offer, when they are a student or just in general less experienced?

I saw a video of yours where you suggested that for landing a job in the field it's good to have like 4 projects: using regression, classification, clustering, and DL or NLP. My question is after I saw the great work Darwin did, is it enough to just focus on like 2 projects or 1 that are/is in our field of interest is? That maybe the number of projects doesn't matter but the quality and the way you present them do?

"After watching this conversation and doing some careful consideration (including trying Datacamp vs. Dataquest) I ended up subscribing to a month of Dataquest and am really happy a  week in.  The context was that even though I had done a self-instruction path of working on projects, including for my current clients, I realized there were major holes in my fundamentals on both Python and R.  So even though I currently have projects I do every day using Pandas, R, and SQL, working in combination for real-world results, I was doing things like Leetcode and realizing my Python basics were really shaky.  Based on this interview in your video, and your feedback about value of looking for free resources vs. paying to have it all in one place, organized well, and with a good teaching tool, I opted to try this for a month.  I was immediately paid back with learning almost all of the exact things I had questions about or was missing in my current knowledge.  I was also very impressed with the curriculum on Dataquest and feel it is worth the monthly payments right now to very quickly acquire a base standard of data science knowledge that is in some ways 1:1 with current standard practices and knowledge.  Given your 66 days of data science challenge coming up, I think it was fortunate timing for my own ongoing efforts to pivot to this field from my current area of expertise, online programmatic ad ops.  Interviews like this really do provide a lot of value for those of us looking for answers and realistic, and honest, appraisals of solutions.

"Hi Ken

Thank you so much, you came from havean for me.

I started learning just around a month ago (Im lost .....🤪)

for me as an electrical engineer (Industrial: oil & gas), data science like different planet.
my mathematical background is very strong, but coding experience is absolute zero.

I found myself really taken by data science.
For now, i focus only on Python, (we will see the rest after that)
check out freecodecamp.org, they have a very great program with free certificate. their YouTube videos made by university doctors

Great Job Hero🏆

Believe me, Im cheering for you man, like you made a triple points with a big dunk🏀.

"Hi Ken
I actually worked on building a simple Youtube Video categorization model using just the title and description. When I plotted those text metadata using a T-SNE plot I could see that videos from the same category where not compressed together rather they were scattered around forming occasional blobs of different category videos clustered together.

So, I wanted to know that how does Youtube actually categorize its videos because 'title+description' doesnt seem to be very specific.

Now question: Could you and us the rest of your community also have some discussion on, say, Kaggle on regular basis? I feel like that, for newcomers like me, it would help navigate the kaggle ""maelstrom"" and be less intimidated, as well as having a clearer road map.
As for you, it would help you both reexamine your fundemantals through teaching as well as helping you establish yourself as a good, proficient teacher that has both passion for the field and is teaching it with the best of intentions. :)

like i am really confused about embeddings and models like BERT,GLOVE etc.
it would really help if you could explained "" where they will be used "" with few example in the video.

Thanks.

The pros and cons between the two. I am acquiring a bachelors in Computer science and am wondering if it would be more beneficial to acquire the data science degree with the Internship opportunities down town Chicago or master in CS.

"Hey Ken, I was not sure if you saw the response I made on your scraping glassdoor video. But here is the code that scrapes the titles of glass door. 

The main advantages are that it is more efficient(code wise) and it is much faster then selenium. I also did this in beautiful soup which Is not a super scalable library, but it illustrates the power of scraping tools. If you want to scale on a larger level, I recommend learning scrapy. Additionally, there is also a tool available that lets you select the exact css element of a web-page I will re-link it again. Anyways, here is the code that scrapes the job titles for glassdoor. 

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from urllib.request import urlopen,Request
import pandas as pd 
import random
import pickle



headers = {""User-Agent"": ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.3""}



website = ""https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/data-scientist-jobs-SRCH_KO0,14.htm""

for i in range(1):
    req = Request(website, headers=headers)
    page = urlopen(req)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'html.parser')
    for item in soup.select("".jobLink span""):
        print(item.get_text())


Lastly, you may be wondering how to go to different pages with the code and how you can scrape elements that are not on the front page of the website.

How to interact on kaggle to attract the attention of other people, the kind that are helpful and, likewise, how can a newbie, like me, make a contribution ourselves as beginners on kaggle.
And in general, what are the best ways to interact on the platform. 
I ask because I believe finding some form of mentor-ship from experienced people is one of biggest key or advantages you can get in learning any field, but ML in particular ( your youtube videos and frank kane courses from sundog are good example). 
Of course, gaining some kind of a more direct mentor-ship goes hand in hand with yourself being able to help and make contributions in return (which seems the whole philosophy being kaggle) so I was wondering if you would be willing to share a few secrets there.

I agree that the best way for learning Data Science is by doing projects, so do you think that the best could be finding projects for ""beginners"" on Kaggle or it could be better to do Kaggle projects without any kind of ""limit"" (so in this case just with the purpose of increasing skills by doing different kind of data analysis)?

basically only want to lern about how to network in this field and get their foot into the door,

"What he said about ""not understanding Kaggle notebook"" is very relatable! I'm a software developer and I started taking interest in data science.
When I read other people's work on Kaggle the first time, I got discouraged because I didn't understand their thought process. As I started doing more courses online through Kaggle, taking other courses, and just playing around with some dataset, I slowly began to understand other people's work.

"Hello there :)

I haven't watched the full video yet, but there's a reason for this and is linked to a suggestion I'd like to propose to you for similar videos in the future:

Despite being very VERY green in this, I decided to have a first go at this all by myself ... and boy was and is it still frustrating :P The reason behind this was that I wanted to try a first attempt without a guiding hand. Once I finished my first model, I quickly realized that there were tons of ways where I blundered like a total noob ... which is actually totally fine :) And despite the frustration of the experience, it felt like I gathered valuable experience from this.

And it is only now that I am starting to watch this video .. but only bit by bit, as I want to try to do as much by myself as possible (mistake be damned since they are being done at home where it won't hurt anyone and where I can learn safely from the experience).

SO my suggestion is this:
Could it be possible for future similar videos to have it in several parts? Or, at the very least, to timestamp the different section of your handling of a particular problem? I feel like it could be very valuable, especially for very recent newcomers like me. 

Anyways, thanks a ton for your videos, very much appreciated ! (especially some of the code where you use apply and lambda functions to handle data transformations, this is definitely something that will be useful for me in the near and long future! :)

A total newbie at this.",Ugznp8yBWv8W9EJOU4R4AaABAg,1,2,2020-08-18 18:35:32+00:00,I3FBJdiExcg,user_1105,Positive,2020-08-18

"Dear Ken, am sorry to hear about this.

The saddest thing is that those who indulge to plagiarism do not understand that this practice tends to damage themselves, and you rightly highlight this aspect.

If we want to strive for excellence, then we must unveil the logic and try hard on our own. Plagiarism does give one the opportunity to feel knowledgeable for one day, but in the long term it will likely show how miserable one is.

The question is, how might we seek out whether we have been plagiarized? 

The topic of plagiarism concerns youtube too. Do you want evidence?
Just look around and see how many times people post videos using copyrighted material. Soccer is one of the many examples. Or TV/radio programs. People merely do NOTHING and try to get visibility - and even money - using other's effort.

"Hello all and Mr. Ken Jee,

It is very humble of Mr. Ken to just have a light eye the  person who copied his work. I am a learning individual myself. I do visit kaggle and github but to just get an idea of how the person has solved the problem and then i take almost one to two weeks to come up with my own unique solution. Solving takes time. Learn from elders and create something on your own. Again Mr. Ken is being very much liberal here. But you will face a big issue when you go for Masters or research jobs. You will get caught and it won't look good. One other thing that Mr. Ken did not address of course he doesn't want to scare the young ones is that a company hold power to blacklist you after being caught of fraud. This means that you won't be able to apply for that company for upto 3 years or forever depending on the policy and also the company can suggest your blacklisted profiles to partner organizations and you will be totally **screwed**. 

Shadow learning is something very important to learn. Shadows learning suggests learning the first principles from others works . This means learning the thought process and not copying the core work. Most of the researchers have 2 ways of reaching a new success. One is making something better or creating something new. Shadow learning is something Einstein has done it himself. He worked as a clerk in a patent office for years going through the research papers or maxwell's , newtons , etc. Did he copy ? Absoluetly not. When he found out that he was a bit lagging in the math section of E=MC^2 he contacted maxwell for his expertise on the derivations. That's how we have Einsein-Maxwells Equation. See. Einstein himself wasn't shy of giving credit to the fellow scientists. Why should kids like us be shy of mentioning a partner or co worker or the sources name or the persons name ? 

Have an open mind like newton. Let the apple fall and create something new. 

Cheers and All the best .

"Great topic and good video. I think you set the appropriate tone overall.
I believe most people learn by copying/following along/mimicry (whatever it is called) at first. I know that I have reproduced projects for the sake of learning. Now when I follow along with someone's project I find it REALLY helpful to state where it came from on top. This way I know where it came from and can return to the original material later if need be.

"This is a very important topic, I agree!
As you have said, using someone else's code is very common in DS or just tech in general,
however it is important to credit the people correctly.
Some people may think ""I could have written that code myself"", which can of course be true in some situations,
but I like to think that using code is at least somewhat comparable to quoting in literature.
If you use a normal sentence such as ""the weather was nice"" obviously you don't need to quote anyone.
But if you want to use a longer paragraph of text (or code, in that matter) it is very important to show the source.
Now in literature this is made pretty easy by placing quotation marks and just referencing the author but because code
stays below the surface in many areas plagiarism can go unnoticed for far longer, even though it is not less important to credit people in
tech than it is in literature.
Thank you for making this video and bringing a bit of light onto this topic, I think this is something which should be made very clear!

Edit: When writing I just noticed that it makes a lot of sense for one's self to give proper credit as well. As you said it makes people happy to see their code being used well. So if you give proper credit you not only make yourself feel good, because you did the right thing, but also the creator, because their work was used and they got credit. On the other hand, if you don't credit, you feel bad for plagiarizing and the other person becomes angry because of it. So giving proper credit is basically a win-win!",UgzdoraYnEIrmKc53jZ4AaABAg,1,1,2020-08-07 16:41:34+00:00,vQGJvmhpq_s,user_830,Positive,2020-08-07

"Thank you for this informative video Sir, this is truly helpful to young inexperienced present and soon to become data scientists such as myself. As far as plagiarism goes with respect to code I have a question. I'm sure that even on the internet there are some niche, common and popular data sets which are considered to be the kind of must do's for new data scientists. In such a scenario its probable that 2 entirely different unrelated and isolated data scientists decide to use the exact same methodology to analyze the data, in such scenarios how should one go about giving the due credit to the people who have already employed similar if not the same method for analysis? 
Additionally on a completely unrelated note I have a school level (class 11th and 12th, high school) coding competition coming up comprising of 2 rounds. The first one being questions related to coding and java, python and c++ and the 2nd round being solving 3 real world problems using code under the span of 1 hour. The second round is purely python coding based. I only know vanilla python well (most of the general functions and methods) and have no experience with either java or c++. I was thinking of learning some modules I've briefly learned the foundations of throughout high school such as numpy, math, csv and either pyqt5 or tkinter. Do you have any tips for me that could help me win this competition? Its my first coding competition and I want to test myself against other coders from other schools and most of all see if my efforts have borne fruit. Any tips or other modules I should revise or learn would be extremely helpful.
Finally I have one last question, I've researched this quite a bit on both YouTube and the internet through articles but I haven't found any satisfactory answer to a question. What's it like to be a Data Scientist, I'm not asking the work schedule or when a DS wakes up what he/she does at the start of the day and then what they do at work and after returning home what work do they do related to DS. I want to know what is a data science life in general, what do you do on off days, how much ""me"" time do you get, what kind of holidays do you get to connect with friends and families and just take it easy and take a break from work. I'm eager to know the ""life"" side of work life balance with regards to being a data scientist.

"Super cool to see that you also build computers. About you breaking your side panel, the funny thing is the same thing happened to my friend about a month ago who ordered that same lian li mid-tower case. He wasnt sure where he could purchase another panel separetely so he purchased another new case entirely. After watching him gently  placing the side panel down on the floor to remove the film it shattered again lol. I also just upgraded very recently and made sure not to purchase that one and went with the nzxt.

"Hi Ken, I think you're the best guy I can ask this question. I have one year left in the Master of ""Economic Analysis & Modelling"" in Rabat, Morocco. I am familiar with Excel, R, and statistical packages like EViews & SPSS, but I was rejected from many Data Analyst internships in the US. So for now I started an internship in Morocco, where I basically make a questionnaire for a certain sampe, collect data, and analyse results. I have been also learning Python and Tableau because they were mentioned in the requirements of most Data analyst internships. Do you think I can land an internship next spring in the US with my anticipated level. Also how was the evolution of Data Analyst jobs and internships impacted by Covid 19.

"Thank you for making this informative video Sir! You stated that inculcation of an additional discipline along with Data Science provides a boost to your resume, however for students who are aspiring to be data scientists and will shortly join college, how will they be able to get the added benefit of having experience in another discipline. If I restrict my argument to myself, I will be pursuing either a DS or a CS under graduate degree, how can I compete against individuals who have the added edge of another discipline. 
Another question I have is could you do a full tutorial style video on how one goes about making their profiles on platforms such as LinkedIn, GitHub or Stack Overflow (And which platform carries the most weight in recruiters' eyes), as an adolescent I feel daunted by the thought of making a good profile as not only am I inexperienced but I'm also unaware of the do's and dont's. Videos such as these project reviews are extremely useful for more experienced watchers but a video targeted towards the newcomers would be a boon.

"Youtube suggested your channel and I had to watch. It was last week. Then I returned in order to find a video on ""Where"" to start learning. But, what you talked about was ""How to learn"". I mean, the advices were ""No matter what courses you watch, just make sure to do in a way that you feel that works for you. Look into Kaggle and learn from built projects"" and such. However what I couldn't find is exactly where to start on languages. 

Please, please, don't get me wrong I'm just trying to understand where to focus the inicial focus to learn this science.


What I was looking for was something more fundamental, like ""Start learning Progamming Logics, then you should tackle the basics of a programming language like R or Python, then you should learn about DB with...""
I don't even know if it is necessary to learn about database to be on Data Science lol.

Again, don't get me wrong. In reality I'm asking you: What are the fundamentals to start to learn this awesome job?
I see the enthusiasm about this topic on your videos and for a long time I had this will to learn, however I'm not a programmer myself, in any language at all. Could you please, help me to find the initial step?

"Hello Ken, really cool video. I have a question for you. You gave us all the important variables that contributed to the model at around 32:30. I was wondering, with those variables in mind, are we able to dig a little deeper and see what the actual values were that contributed most to the model? 
If that sounds confusing, here is an example. Age is the second most significant variable in the model. If we can program what I just asked you, the model would ""spit"" out ages 15-18 years, I do not know if that's true, old were the most significant and contributed most to the model. 
This is my first data science project, so I want to apologize in advance if my words do not sound ""data sciency"" enough.",UgzRBsDUkmKAME2WCcl4AaABAg,3,1,2020-07-29 18:08:19+00:00,I3FBJdiExcg,user_3132,Positive,2020-07-29

"Hi, Ken, when tuning the model for random forest, you use RandomizedSearchCV and then GridSearchCV. Your comment is 
""Because the total feature space is so large, I used a randomized search to narrow down the paramters for the model. I took the best model from this and did a more granular search ""
Do your mean the GridSearchCV' parameters are based on the its above RandomizedSearchCV' results?",UgxbM0ptt3bkAgXoN614AaABAg,2,3,2020-07-29 13:03:26+00:00,I3FBJdiExcg,user_3802,Positive,2020-07-29
"@ ken jee good day bro and thanks 4 all the content,have been downloading each one, am about embarking on a masters program in data science At the industrial university Tyumen and all I have is a b.sc in mathematics,your videos have been helpful,as I seek to begin a career defining path in data science! But the masters program, I feel a bit insecure having no background in data science but plan on remedying that by going thru your advice on how to start data science from scratch! , plan to use my first year in personal study while learning the language to learn and gain mastery in data science so by the second year while am going into the core of the program,am caught up,what do u think, too much or just ambitious enough!

"Hello Sir! I'm a student whose currently studying in class 12th and I've chosen the career path of a Data Scientist. Your channel is actually the first channel I've ever subscribed to, because from the first video that I saw on your channel about whether one should choose a bootcamp, a certificate or a masters' degree, I've been hooked to your channel and have seen most of your videos. First of all thank you for making them, its extremely difficult to find any person on youtube or otherwise that provides such comprehensive guides, it really helps aspiring data scientists like me a lot! Secondly I'd like to ask you whether I should aim for a CS undergraduate degree or a DS one, I've seen a plethora of videos and then I've realized that at present the CS is the go to degree, however the shift of preference from CS to DS is occurring and I'm trying to think ahead that when I graduate, would a DS degree increase my chances of getting hired or would the norm still remain CS. I'd be extremely grateful if you could provide some insight into this.
As for the name of your new beast of a machine, I'd suggest the name Kronos from Greek mythology, the Titan of Time (I'm a fan of Percy Jackson and other works of Rick Riordan). Kronos would probably be the perfect name because -
1. You said at the start your build was made around your gpu, the rtx TITAN, so for the computer to share a name with an actual Titan from mythology would be pretty cool
2. Seeing the specs I'm sure this machine will be crazy fast and that'll result in much faster response times and code compilation times, seeing that time is such an essential aspect here it makes the name Kronos even more fitting since he was the Titan of Time
3. The age of the Titans is called the Golden Age in greek mythology, seeing that your graphics card is also golden, i think it makes perfect sense

Once again thank you making these videos, they really are a huge help!

"Thanks Ken for this amazing podcast, really enjoyed the discussion. I totally agreed on sharing data science work socially. As a researcher, sharing my data science work on has opened several doors of opportunities. For one, people who see the work that I share socially may reach out to me with opportunities to apply for research grants, to take part in awesome collaborative research projects, to take part in editorial roles in research journals, prospective students reach out to join our research group, serve as the starting point for collaborative discussions, to serve as external examiners of PhD dissertation, etc. 
     As a YouTuber, I learn a lot from the subscribers (questions, suggestions, feedbacks, tips and tricks, etc.), collaborate and engage in discussions with other awesome YouTubers such as Ken Jee, Krish Naik, Dhaval Patel, Jay Feng, Jaemin Lee, etc. 
     Aside from this, the act of sharing is like paying it forward. Imagine if we all share, the collective intelligence of all the awesome ideas and works would serve as amazing resource to learn, get inspired and create further awesome data science work. 😃",Ugwk_fQWtol6u8JYFs54AaABAg,1,1,2020-07-23 14:57:43+00:00,ELFGsNqZrlM,user_1178,Positive,2020-07-23

I am a Mechanical Engineer for seven years. I don’t have a lot of experience in programming or data science. I am looking at taking Bootcamp for Data Sciences at USC, but it is an offer by Trilogy.

"Learning how to learn and breakdown information was one of the best skills I obtained from my academic experience. Oddly, learning data science has been more rewarding thus far, mostly because of being self-reliant on myself and becoming independent. Not having a syllabus and everything planned/laid out in front of you is a skill in itself. It is great to be able to obtain the skills regardless of background as long as you put the work in. This means a lot to me as someone who was a first-gen student, and college isn't always attainable or even the right path. Now to advocate for internet accessibility across the U.S. and also the globe. Thank you both for the informative interview.

"Ken Jee,
I’m about to start my senior year of college and I’m majoring in physics and math, and I’m starting to get really interested in data science. I’m currently working a research internship in medical physics, and I’m using python with numpy, pandas, etc. to analyze how the accuracy of CT scanners changes from week to week. Even though this internship hasn’t had me use any physics so far, I’ve found the analysis very interesting. I would really like to get a job in data science without going to graduate school. What would you recommend that I do in the next year while I finish up college to best prepare me to land a job? I go to Texas A&M, so we have a huge network, but I don’t know where to start (other than using the kaggle courses). I’ve tried looking at job postings and it seems like all the jobs require a masters degree and/or 4+ years of experience. Thank you!",UgzEzir5Wx4wY_td3dp4AaABAg,1,2,2020-07-16 18:13:27+00:00,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_2178,Positive,2020-07-16

"Hi Ken Jee, thanks for the great content!  I decided around March that I wanted to make a career change into data science and quickly realized it was going to take a lot longer than I originally thought.   Although I have a degree in aerospace engineering I have been working in sales for the past 8 years so my technical skills weren't where they needed to be.  Anyways,  after doing some research I came to the conclusion that starting out in a data analyst role might be a more attainable path for me because of my lack of experience and that form there I could transition into data science once I have real world experience.  
My question for you is, do you believe entering the industry as a data analyst is a good way to do it?  Also, do you have any tips for writing a good resume when you don't have experience?   
I have been taking online courses in SQL and Python and feel pretty proficient in SQL but not so much in Python, still need to work more on that.  
Thanks again for the great content, I appreciate the hard work you've put into sharing your knowledge.",Ugy42o0yB68rann12_N4AaABAg,1,2,2020-07-10 22:20:52+00:00,n3vw0M5RrPU,user_363,Positive,2020-07-10

"Considering that I am now 45 and looking to begin a masters in data science program this fall since my current masters in exercise science has not yielded any sort of suitable or gainful employment, I'd be more than content to find an entry level data analyst role upon graduation from a data science program. Although I have done a handful of projects and have started building a portfolio, I'm hopeful that my chances of getting an internship, landing an entry level data analyst role, or associate data analyst role while going through this master's will be increased.  It's as if I feel starting this masters program will help give me that extra edge to at least obtain the most entry  level position in data analysis versus just my current degree and portfolio. I say this because it seems most job listings require or prefer some kind of quantitative degree, and exercise science does not seem to make the cut. There seems to be too much of a question as to landing an entry level data analyst job even with a much more robust portfolio which I'm sure I could have by year's end.",UgwHzgN-lRqsV5001394AaABAg,1,1,2020-07-10 20:40:04+00:00,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_1243,Positive,2020-07-10
"I found this video to be extremely basic and vague (and the video doesn't quite match the contents: you show very expensive components and then speak how it's not really necessary to have powerful PC for beginners). The general recommendations are fine, but there is no explanation as for when and why you would want to get anything better than Ryzen 5.

What tasks are particularly CPU focused, and will benefit noticeably from e.g. Ryzen 9 processor? If it can save you several hours of computing a day, it can be a big deal, but if it says less than a hour, it's mostly pointless.

The same goes for graphic card. Nvidia RTX Titan seems extremely overpriced for what it does. From what I can tell, it's only slightly better than RTX 2080 Ti, and cots twice as much. Is there even any reason to get it? Maybe some additional optimization for Data Science tasks? So far it looks extremely cost ineffective, even for highest end PC. Might as well get something cheaper for now and then upgrade to RTX 3000 when it launches.

Again, unless it can save several hours of computing every day, I don't see how it makes any sense at all.

Additionally, I wonder how impactful RAM memory speed is for Data Science tasks. Does it make sense to overclock your RAM, or is it just a waste of time and effort?

Finally, I'm not sure if it's correct to simply ignore Motherboard and PSU (You listed a 500$ PC, and then you mentioned 200$ for motherboard and other components, which practically increases the price by 50%). Again, depending on how important storage speed is, it might make sense to get a more expensive motherboard, such as B550 or X570. However, if it's not as important, and regular NVME SSD is more than good enough, then good B450 board is plenty powerful. As for storage Samsung NVME SSDs are way overpriced, so I wouldn't recommend one personally. Good ADATA NVME costs just 70-75$ for 500 GB, and is only marginally slower.

My recommended budget build based in my understanding will depend on the country, but in short here doesn't seem to be any significant differences from general gaming build recommendations.

For processor I'd get Ryzen 5 1600 AF if it's available for under 110$, otherwise Ryzen 5 3600 is the best choice.

For memory if speed is not super important for Data Science tasks I'd recommend Crucial Ballistix Black 2x8 GB 3200 MHz. Even if it is this kit has good overclocking capabilities. Wouldn't get anything below 16 GB, as Chrome is a memory hog, and you likely need a lot of tabs open for data science projects.

For motherboard I'd recommend B450 Mortar Max or Tomahawk Max, as those support upgradability. For cheaper options B450 PRO-VDH Max is also good.

For SSD ADATA SX8200 Pro 500/1000 GB is the best choice (depending on your preferences regarding regularly cleaning your PC). I wouldn't get anything below 500 GB myself, since this will likely cause major inconveniences.

For PSU anything 550-650W is good enough. I wouldn't get anything below Gold certification if your PC runs for 10+ hours every day. If available at reasonable price, Deepcool DQ-650M is a good choice.

Monitor doesn't really matter for Data Science, so anything cheap and sturdy will do.

Graphic card is a tricky one. I'd probably try to look for a good used option for a budget build, but it's hard to find a reliable seller. I assume Nvidia cards are easier to use for Data Science, as AMD cars get less support. Used GTX 1060 6GB is a bare minimum I'd recommend, but if you can afford a more expensive one, 2070 Super looks like an optimal choice in terms of cost to performance. Personally I'd get 1060, and then upgrade to RTX 3070 when available.

As for the case, anything above 60$ should be fine. Got myself new MSI MAG case, it's quite, runs pretty old and comes with fans already pre-installed. More premium options are Phantex P400A, and Meshify C.

Secondary components like motherboard, PSU and case may seem unimportant, but they ultimately affect performance, reliability, upgradability and longevity of the system as we.

Still would like to know how important memory speed is for Data science tasks. 16 GB 2400 MHz and 16 GB 3800 MHz are 2 completely different kits for some tasks.",Ugxn84pxw2qDi-MsktZ4AaABAg,1,0,2020-07-10 19:54:15+00:00,QQLToUlgN7A,user_439,Positive,2020-07-10

"Hi Ken,
I was wondering the level of math you need for DS, I’m getting mixed results in my research. I was a biology major in undergrad and the highest math I ever had to take was calculus I (basically just doing derivatives), and this was a long time ago so I don’t remember how to do it anymore. I was exploring data science masters back in my school and others, and they’re open to non STEM majors, and the most math they require was statistics.
  Do you need to know differential equations, linear algebra, and more advanced calculus? Or statistics and the various statistical tests covered in statistics will be fine?",UgyLuvdtd7o8UFw8Uwh4AaABAg,3,9,2020-07-10 16:59:49+00:00,3Mm1U1CbzNw,user_2687,Positive,2020-07-10

i saw that both you and this guy are interested in data science, so i woud like to listen also your tips.
I have a question about data science filed: do you think that a bachelor degree in statistic is more useful than a computer science degree for go into this field? in my country statistic is a sub field of social scinece and there are only few course of computer science,just databases,fundametal programming and statiscal sw. 
A computer scientist has more skills in programming,they study for example more sw exams  (sw enginners,operation system ) but less statistic,probability ecc.
I read that company prefer more computer scientist beacause they dont nedd statistician that are expert in hard modelling,math ecc but they usually ""suck"" in it field,like programming ecc.  but they need only basic knowledge of statistic and a lot of It skills.
So wht do you think, is a good investimetn a bachelor in statisitic or is better a computer science degree? there are a lot of master degree in data science from both accademical course, a lot of people with a bachelour in computer science go in to statistic and viceversa.

"I'm trying to decide if this field is for me. I use Sales Force at work and  occasionally have to pull raw data from it. I use rudimentary search words or phrases to try to isolate cases our front line agents log from their customer contacts.

Often, however, there are limits to the results I get and almost always the data I get is so poorly captured that it inevitably means I have to manually read hundreds of thousands of records individually to see if there are trends. The categorization of the data is a separate challenge of its own.

We have folks who created a system that does this automatically, however, it's still high level information the way the issues get bucketed. It's also about 2-3 days behind so trying to get data real time is another limit.

I'm new to this, so I envision being to run raw data up to hour and be able to paint the picture of what's driving call volume, trends, for example, that we may need to act on immediately and then having technology/automation do the grunt work to classify the data and give me actionable information to present to my team and leadership. But as I see it, there's the obstacle of getting good data from the agents as the major issue in its own.  Is this even possible? Has anyone else run into this?

I'm gearing up to apply for an online master's in DS.  I have a bachelor's in math and an MS in stats from a decade ago that I ended up not really using (long story).  I've started learning python and I'm not completely sucking at it so I feel like I'm on the right track but my math skills are obviously pretty rusty.  Any idea what kind of math I should brush up on to prepare? 

 The program itself hasn't even started, UT Austin is still putting it together and planning on accepting applications in the next few months.  I was hoping to just get a little ahead of the curve.",UgzqQRc6F2lhXCrZAk54AaABAg,3,1,2020-07-09 22:08:24+00:00,AqPquogHwq0,user_1379,Positive,2020-07-09

My university now offers a dual-degree in computer science and data science that has all of the computer science major courses and some statistics and data science courses. I'm not sure whether or not I should major in CS and continue into an MS in CS and take grad courses related to data science or if I should get the dual-degree in CS and DS.

"Hello Ken! This is my first time watching your video. I'll be checking more videos of yours but if you don't mind could you answer me a question please? I was going to take master's degree in data science in Illinois institute of tech (IIT) from this fall semester (my bachelor is CS) but I got rejected because I didn't take prerequisites such as calculus 1-3 and linear algebra. And then I had to change my major to something related, so I chose IT management in the end because I was interested in management and MBA as well since before. But even now I still feel like compared to data science, my major doesn't seem to be that professional. So I was thinking of teaching myself some mathematics and then studying data analytics with using either R or python through free online courses.

"Hi Ken!
Thank you for this video, I just used your code and built my own little model! Using 2020 data and looking back at the NBA games from back in March I would've correctly picked 9 of the 13 NBA over/unders correctly.
This is a small sample size, but I believe the model I have is pretty accurate. However, I was wondering how I would make it more accurate? Like what new data points I should add to predict the score. I'm very excited about the return of the NBA.",UgyU7xrBxBx8HOUN20J4AaABAg,3,1,2020-07-07 16:19:26+00:00,irjTWNV0eAY,user_4453,Positive,2020-07-07

Every video of yours is exceptionally informative,however there's one question that,how much of data structures and algorithms i should know as compared to a software engineer when interviewing at bigwigs.

I just had some doubts,
Is it necessary to have a degree like you have in computer science ?
What if our college professors do not have adequate knowledge and reach regarding this field ?
We have Calculus in our class 11th and 12th and i have no problems grasping maths concept, although i am not acquainted with physics at all. I was planning to learn Python, Excel and Statistics. Now that you have mentioned Calculus as well, i would be revising that too.
I just wanted to know if i am taking the right steps ?  I am 17 so i have not joined any University yet, but have been taking courses on the above mentioned topics",Ugxs5I4GZhNapBqq1bR4AaABAg,2,2,2020-07-07 00:18:52+00:00,xjhW1rSQeik,user_1472,Positive,2020-07-07

Brilliant work as always. Is it true that there are no datascience jobs and internships for freshers that are recently graduated from college or do they need some work experience in order to get a job. Does being a SWE in a big tech company adds as a advantage to get a job or do we have to have datascience domain experience only to get a job in FANG companies.

"Thank you so much for this series, it's really helpful for beginners like me. I have a question though, I followed almost exactly how you revised the codes, the only difference is probably that I am using data from both Canada and USA, and the ""salary estimate"" column shows all identical values (e.g. CA$89K-CA$100K (Glassdoor Est.)) but all the other columns (e.g. rating, company name) are just fine. This is so confusing to me since the codes formats for reading ""estimate salary"" and ""rating"" are the same. Any insights you can share why this occurs?

"Hello Ken, very refreshing videos! 🙂
I have obtained Master degree in Telecommunications and am working as a network engineer. I have realized that I miss programming so much since I was very good at it and math in high school. I had some programming on college (C, MATLAB, some very basic Python), but since then stopped programming because my job doesn't require it. I like data science, artificial intelligence and Python, so I enrolled in PhD program in IoT where I've got some subjects such are Neural networks and Artificial intelligence in telecommunications.
Please, do you have any advice on how to manage my time since I am doing a job with shifts, have to study and make projects for PhD and need to learn Python, statistics and similar topics in order to make career change and become data scientist? I would much appreciate if you give me concrete examples/materials what to study and pace for passing them.

"Thanks for another great video, Ken! The video editing and transitions are awesome! I certainly agree that one of the misconception of learning data science is limiting one's learning to a particular resource, as you said, nothing is stopping us from learning from another resource. Because the thing is, different resources may bring slightly different angle or coverage of the same topics and thus helps us to gain a more thorough breadth and depth of those topics.

"Thank you Ken for such a wonderful tutorial, it was easy to follow and simple for a beginner to keep up with. I have been scraping Data Science jobs in Canada and they are less than 1000. My num_jobs variable is 1000. So, what is happening is when the scraper reached the last page on glassdoor it is going in a loop and collecting data from the same 5 jobs over and over, I guess it will do that till the length of jobs dictionary reached 1000.

All the work has dried up and I was transitioning to work in film but with restrictions that won't be possible anymore. So I've decided to retrain. I dont know if data science/analytics is right for me because I havent tried it, however I did do well in stats at uni and maths in school. I figure ill give it a go and if i dont like it then what the hell, i only spent $2500 for 6 months of which i wouldn't have worked anyway. Thoughts ?

Thank you really for everything you share with us. I've started my journey in data science a couple months ago. I completed a bachelor's degree in statistics and I would like to convert into Data scientist.

- with my statistician background, do you think I can be good enough to have a job in datascience?
- I have completed datascience 365 bootcamp and I want to know ways to apply all the knowledge I got there.
- how can I find a distance job in any company or enterprise, because in my home country it is quiet difficult since we don't have enterprises really needing it.

"Hi, I've heard also some negative information about this book ""Why we sleep"". I haven't read it yet by myself (but I want to do it soon), but in the other yt video I've heard that author's research are quite questionable, like lower cancer rate when you sleep less than 8h (something like this). I think this makes sense, because just like diet, everybody's need of sleep is different and it should be more personalized aswell. Nobody should force himself to sleep more if his body doesn't need it.

I have a request for the upcoming videos or if you have made one, let me know as well. I would like to know what should we post in a project repository.

"Fist of all, thank you for your time making this series. 
It casted a lot of light to me on the big scheme of things in a  project (how you handle it as a whole) Most resources deal just with certain parts so they miss the big picture.

I'm having a hard time...  
I'm trying to get ready a data set (cleaning, inputing, binning, etc)... i wrote individual functions that take the full dataframe as input and outputs it with the respective transformation/inputation/...
Resources mention that is good practice to write functions... So i did... Then i stumble across custom transformers, now I'm trying to create one to use it rather than the individual functions


What is the difference between using lambda funcitons( like in here) and creating the custom transfomers?

Is it good to write one transformer that will deal with all the steps (cleaning, custom value inputing, changing types of values, discretizing, aggregating categories, etc, etc)  to get my dataset ready?
Or what am i supposed to do?
Then i would like to use it in a pipeline to finish with encoding and scaling...

I'm kinda lost and can't find any good resource to solve this...

Thank so much you and keep the good work!",UgzDA0YtTl1czFLc0M14AaABAg,2,1,2020-06-15 21:22:50+00:00,fhi4dOhmW-g,user_1131,Positive,2020-06-15

"Congratulations. Not too long ago when I subscribed to your channel after watching the NBA simulation video I think you had something like a few thousand subscribers. Now you're at 50,000+; a testament to the quality of content you're putting out. Keep em coming.",UgznmkBjW1FaF8nlcrx4AaABAg,1,2,2020-06-15 17:00:16+00:00,UcilY6HDuL8,user_1086,Negative,2020-06-15
"Nice video! I'm not familiar with your channel but saw the thumbnail/its length and clicked through - a few other ideas/resources to choose from that I think can be really helpful for beginners depending on how they like to learn:
---------------
1. Make a habit of partitioning off a small portion of your learning time to do some light reading on best practices - this is softer information and can often be more subjective than the harder skills, but it can be extremely helpful in adding context to why certain things are the way they are and potentially help save you some cleanup down the road (things like docstrings, virtual environments, project directory structure, etc). (Like everything else) this can be overwhelming and my advice would also be to choose one thing at a time and start trying to build it into your workflow - docstrings and virtual environments are both good examples of things that take a little getting used to but can feel very fluid after a short period of time and save a lot of headaches with package managers (+ if you're using vscode or PyCharm the autodocstrings are great and keep your time spent doing the things the machine can't, not playing with margins)
---------------
2. Listening to podcasts about the subject (IMO) is also extremely valuable and can be done on the go - even if as a beginner you don't understand much that they're talking about, hearing others talk about common problems before you get to them can help you understand what's happening more quickly whenever you do. Additionally, a huge part of this field is learning how to articulate the problem you're trying to solve for on google/stack, and listening to podcasts can help you learn how to articulate things better both verbally and in writing. I'm much less familiar with the R podcast landscape but for Python beginners, Talk Python To Me is great for slightly deeper dives into a specific problem domain and Python Bytes is good/fun weekly exposure to the evolving packaging landscape.
2.1 Quick addition to the above point, another thing it can really help with is understanding the extent to which most problems, particularly on the data processing/cleansing/wrangling front have already been solved for - I've often seen more novice programmers try to recreate the wheel at every turn and hearing more experienced people unpack how they approach problem solving can help save you from writing a script to do something that's part of a standard library.
---------------
3. Time spent finding the right resources is never time wasted - in addition to paid courses/etc, I'd encourage finding someone on Youtube/similar who does a good job of articulating things in a way that makes sense to you. Corey Schafer has a  fantastic Python channel covering everything from basics/best practices to end-to-end application development
---------------
4. Acknowledging that this would fall somewhere towards the latter half of the progression outlined in your video, I think it's super worth calling out that all the services we use personally have open APIs from which we can programmatically extract our data from and can be a great way to build out your mechanics in a fun/more personal way - it's also a natural and safer step towards web scraping since it's all the same communication protocol. Amongst many others, Spotify has a super user-friendly API and a well-supported helper library called Spotipy for anyone who might like this idea and be looking for a place to start Python beginnings to start learning how APIs work.
---------------
Again great video and I hope the data dump's welcomed:)",Ugyo30ljcYFJXIXeB-N4AaABAg,1,1,2020-06-15 16:57:16+00:00,4OZip0cgOho,user_1698,Positive,2020-06-15

"Hey Ken, I recently graduated from university with a major in psychology and a double minor in computer science and mathematics. I struggled a lot with the learning environment of university, and unfortunately wasn't able to pursue a masters degree. Instead, I've taken a real interest in data science, more specifically machine learning, and have starting taking some courses online! I plan on doing a data science bootcamp later, which looks promising from the research I've done. My plan is extremely raw, but I hope to combine machine learning and psychology for the benefit of therapy and other aspects of the human mind!

Time series and customer analytics are much easier to understand. The final five modules are basically implementation and are mainly ML. How should i advance? like learning more advanced ML and DL?

hopefully I can also persevere. I have been taking the Kaggle micro courses but recently I’m thinking about quitting because the machine learning part is getting frustratingly hard. I have so many questions because the reading doesn’t explain every line of code thoroughly. Mindlessly copypasting code from tutorial to exercise problems really makes me question the rationale of learning data science. I have no one to ask for help so I think it’s extra hard because I have to google everything which is super time consuming and I don’t often find the answers I need.,UgyBsVqyPO3C4sl22oV4AaABAg,1,1,2020-06-13 02:41:14+00:00,XjC3FPL-S78,user_2204,Neutral,2020-06-13

"This was a really great analogy towards the process of learning data science. This reminds me of my data structures class from freshman year where my professor said that even though that most people will have the same type of code to solve a problem, there are many different ways to approach it. Pretty much just like how there are many different ways to learn something. I'm still on this journey as well and just like the advice given here, I use resources that make the most sense to me when I'm developing projects. I relate to the small wins thing as well whether it would be making tutorials for Data Science concepts for the organization that I'm a part of, the Bit Project, or making projects through the knowledge that I have gained through tutorials. Of course my code wouldn't be as complex as someone else's work, the important thing is that I made something that I'm proud of and that the ability to continuously learn will get you far on this journey.

"I already had a solid Math background when I started learning DS - but my graduation was 25 years ago :) I also had a LOT of programming experience, but not in Python or R. And still, my greatest problem wasn't the Math or the Python, it was *lack of the systematic approach*.
When you go for one of the countless ""become a data scientist in 10 hours"" course, you don't really understand that material. The worst thing is you might THINK you understand it, but that's a false feeling. There is no way to understand it all in 10 hours, be prepared for a long journey or retreat. There are three books that I recommend to everyone:
1). Mathematics for Data Scientists (M.P.Deisenroth and others) - all math you will need in a convenient form.
2). Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analysis (Johh D. Kelleher and others) - everything about Machine Learning except for the neural networks.
3). Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron - a great book about Deep Learning (you may skip the other parts).

All three books have a lot of exercises, and you should do ALL of them. After that you will know enough to consider your knowledge solid. I've stopped on the exercises for the very first chapter for now, though I've read the books, of course :)",UgzPsR1oPWxAcWJvuEt4AaABAg,4,29,2020-06-12 18:12:58+00:00,XjC3FPL-S78,user_1903,Positive,2020-06-12

"Hi Ken, as always it's a pleasure to watch your video that distinguishes you from the many yackers around talking about data science.

When i was listening to you, it came into my mind Tim Ferris and i thought about ""selection"", one of the key steps to learning.
In my idea, to learn data science the first step involves figuring out what are the most frequently used and important mathematical models and algorithms. 
Once we have this shortlist, we can select key programming languages - i personally opt for Python and R - and try to work out real-world problems with these 2 languages. 

How, do we do to know if we are gonna do well? One way is to pick algorithms as performed in any of the courses you proposed (or even in Kaggle, where i have been starting giving a look), implementing to the real-world problems as said above and double-checking the solution by implementing the same algorithms using secondary, high-level programming environments like Matlab or Mathematica. 
I know that mathematica has lot of functions that help you do what in python requires dozens of lines.

I think the advice you give is very useful, because I've been following the same methodology when learning Data Science for the past year.

Would you mind giving me a little bit more information about this? I generally put my analysis writing on my Medium.com and code on Github. Then I connected the two together because I got those Medium.com articles that got featured on TowardsDataScience. Plus, Medium.com generally provides a much better layout for my project analysis. Do you think that approach is much better compared to just publish the analysis on Github?

"I think learning by doing is a wonderful, fun and efficient way to learn a range of skills.  HOWEVER, after 40+ years developing for large, medium and small commercial, non-profit, military/defense and other companies across communications, strategic data, media, AI, quantum-AI, full stack and other areas, I have also seen the dangers of that as a primary, let alone singular learning approach.   

People who learn exclusive via doing— especially working predominately on their own while eschewing theory and complementary skills prior to that approach, often have major applied theory and application context gaps in their knowledge that they appear generally unaware of.  Obviously, this depends whether you are learning predominately on your own, or if you have guide(s), mentor(s) and/or teacher(s) that help point out short-comings and gaps in your knowledge base and approaches. 

There are multiple factors underlying this problem.  First, it is very hard for most people to deeply self-introspect to see where they lie on broad based external knowledge continuums without significant sources of historical, theoretical and contextual reference.  This is why the first factor of where people are on the Dunning-Kruger curve skews left with people who have largely self-educated without a broader base of external references as noted above.  

The second factor is the fact that most of the time, most people simply do not know what they don’t know.  In other words, it takes a broad base of external theoretical, historical and contextual learning to develop metacognitive skills to help us intuit where we have gaps in our knowledge base, and to consistently discern correct from incorrect conclusions.  While working on our own is a great way to learn deep, practical skills, we see that it often comes along with blinders to broader alternative views and approaches.  In other words, you can easily be unwittingly blind to the fact that your toolbox is mostly bare, and that you don’t know how to optimally use even the tools you do have.  For example, we see people who have never heard of Donald E. Knuth, JADD or Charles Petzold that have instead learned simply by doing, who code using approaches that others have long since bypassed, resulting in programming that causes problems and often must be rewritten and projects that must be taken over by other groups— ideally prior to them causing real world problems in the end user community.  

So, while there is no substitute for hands on learning and many have succeeded in becoming gainfully employed as programmers without much classical computer programming training or academic education;  even hands-on learning approaches work better in the form of a balanced apprenticeship approach, where you work autonomously, but under the direction and oversight of someone much more knowledgeable and skilled than yourself.

The fact is that the number of software developers on the planet doubles every 5 years.  As such, by definition this means that half of software developers have less than 5 years experience.  The number goes down as you get to more specialized areas of knowledge that increasingly can have a broad based impact in unforeseen ways on the future of humanity.  For example, the number of AI programmers is doubling every 12-14 months and is still falling.  

This means that on average, AI programmers have a year or less programming skills in AI.  Increasingly, the percentage that have any significant general programming or computer science education is dropping, as the demand for AI programmers is far outstripping what our universities and training centers can provide.  As such, more people are self-educating, often by jumping in and doing prior to getting any significant training.  

Sadly, many of us who don’t get the academic knowledge and theory up front, never go back later to address that, since they get too busy and immerse in immediate needs.  So, the gaps and deficiencies upon entering the workforce often are carried throughout their carrier.  Often they become highly proficient programmers and such, in whatever language(s) they happen to need for the tasks at hand, but they often don’t learn to intuit when, for example they should turn to something like Node.js versus Python, or use Matlab vs Tensorflow, etc,

So, what is the negative result of people learning predominately hands-on rather than under the oversight of others who are significantly more knowledgeable and skilled, and preferably with a good foundation of theory and broad based learning to bolster their metacognitive, theory and analytical skills development?   The result is that suboptimal approaches, zero hour bugs, and higher rates of failed projects, as defined by the failure to meet one or more primary deliverables as defined by the final SOW.   

Further, as AI is integrating to the very fabric of our digital world, we are seeing a wide range of badly trained and architected systems that are leading to avoidable deaths, flash crashes in major global markets, just in time delivery system failures and much more.  We know the causes of these are often programmers who are being primarily trained autonomous hands-on approaches.

So, given that traditional education in the form of BS, MS and PhD’s in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people from a financial standpoint, what are the alternatives?  First, online learning when done in conjunction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful high utility educational base.  Further, programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in. 

Also, as AI is integrating to the very fabric of our digital world, we are seeing a wide range of badly trained and architected systems that are leading to avoidable deaths, flash crashes in major global markets, just in time delivery system failures and much more.  We know the causes of these are often programmers who are being primarily trained autonomous hands-on approaches.

So, given that traditional education in the form of BS, MS and PhD’s in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people, what are the alternatives.  First, online learning when done in conjuction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful way to learn.  Further, programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in.  For example, say you spent a few hundred hours learning and taking on a few projects in Python and Swift.  You should also read several of the seminal computer programming theory and related books— at the very least in the areas you are focusing on, and preferably add to them over time once you have internalized their benefit.  Statistics repeatedly show that people who never learned core theory prior to beginning a career have a much lower chance of ever learning those areas.

Similarly, it can be a great boon to identify a local universities or a company that needs interns where you can work under and along side others with different skills. While the pay may be minimal or non-existent, EVERYONE (self-taught, university skilled and all other modalities of learning) should intern— just as is done in other mission critical and related fields like medicine.   And it is a LOT cheaper than the college alternative.  In medicine it is done on top of 6-9 years of additional post-university graduation education, while in computer programming, a rapidly increasing percentage never even get any post graduation training of any significant merit— let alone intern/apprenticeship training.   

Is professional programming any less deep or broad of an area of knowledge?   Not if you want to excel in terms of being at least well rounded and far more employable than average— and definitely not if you wish to excel in skills, compensation and job satisfaction.  So, don’t migrate primarily to hands-on without getting a good base of other approaches behind you, because statistically you probably will never go back to rectify the competency, knowledge and related gaps you create by doing so.",Ugw59or26G9iQZ4Yayl4AaABAg,0,1,2020-06-06 18:28:57+00:00,4OZip0cgOho,user_434,Positive,2020-06-06

Now I have 2 questions that might sound stupid lol.

1. I am currently starting with the housing project and I didn't know how to start on my own so Im using 2 other notebooks as references and kind of copy pasting, would you consider that  normal when starting or is it bad ?(I'm gonna reference links to both of them when I finish my work of course)

2. For the getting started projects in Kaggle in general and the ones you mentioned in this video when do you think I can say I succeeded with this project like what's the minimus end goal in the score or something like that ?

"Hey you, Ken! Really nice channel you have here. You've got one more subscriber. =)
.
Here in Brazil we have this kind of discussion every day. And for the ones who is not from the field, but really passionate about data and the math behind it - and of course have enough time to do so -, won't you recommend a second bachelor related to the field? For example: Statistics, Computer Science, Mathmatics, and so on? 
.
Briefly, I think for the tools, softwares, programming languages there are no better place to learn them than in online courses. Thus, the bachelor would give us the theory we need and in parallel sharp our skills with online courses. 
.
I'm curious to know your opinion about it. Cheers from Brazil, buddy!",UgzmdRutZoyRnolJAkd4AaABAg,1,2,2020-06-05 11:10:13+00:00,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_1863,Positive,2020-06-05

"Hi guys! 
So, it seems like this has stopped working, I found the fix on Github tho, 
Here's how to go about it: 
This can be fixed by modifying the header dictionary in query.py from
HEADER = {'User-Agent': random.choice(HEADERS_LIST)}
to
HEADER = {'User-Agent': random.choice(HEADERS_LIST), 'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest'}
that should fix the issue.

"Hi Ken, i need your honest opinion man

I'm confused in choosing between Data Scientist or UX Designer

There are few questions about this topic, but i want to ask from different perspective

I am right now a content creator, was a videographer so i do edit videos and such

Visualization is always a part of me, i like to vizualize things like when i hear music i can imagine the videos that fits the music

But what i asked is much bigger than that

I know lots of people talk about what you're more into, if maths go with data science, if creative go with ux design

However, i want to know how's the life of both careers? Which one offer better work life balance?

Because when i did creative work, i didn't really have work life balance, i did a lot of overwork stuffs, because creative work sometimes requires you to think constantly or out of the box that really absorbed your attention even outside of your work hours.

When i go outside, my body is in holiday mode but my mind is not there, thinking of the unfinished project.

Then second, which one is more important and irreplaceable? Because i see lots of websites now offering design templates which mean maybe in the future, companies don't really need ux designer since they can use good templates from the internet. 

Third, when you become the CEO of the company. Which skill is best to master? Data science or ux design? That will absolute critical as someone in that position. 

Like to hear your thoughts about this, thank you",UgxKGQhrM7h3HfQDrsZ4AaABAg,2,2,2020-06-02 06:22:14+00:00,mR2NCRgtLPE,user_289,Positive,2020-06-02
"So on 31st May I searched youtube for ""Data science portfolio website"" and found this awesome video posted just 2 days before! I have made my first portfolio website thanks to you guys!! Thank you!!
One heads up for anyone making their own site in this way:
After uploading files some of the images might not load on the page (when run using Github pages)
This happens because some images that were uploaded have the src = ""/images/.."" 
To get the photos simply edit the index.html file for the pages where the images are missing. 
Change the ""/images/.."" to  ""https://dataprofessor.github.io/Ken_Portfolio/images/.."" and the images will show

I have an electronics engineering degree but work as a biomedical technician in a hospital. Haven’t used any coding since college but use a lot of exceI. I was thinking of getting a data science specialization course and then a masters in data science at the end of the year. School can be partially covered by my employer. I was thinking about moving into an analytics or data engineering role at my hospital. Would that be a good route?

simple answer: Bootcamp. I speak from experience. I have only  6 credits left to finish my MS Computer Science degree and I can tell you right from the bat.......I learn more about tools that I will actually use on the job market from youtube not from my masters classes. Bootcamp is more hands on. You learn by working on projects not reading some text book and doing a quiz (The answers to the quizzes are on quizlet anyways),UgwitX0_axCWjUFCgcF4AaABAg,2,1,2020-05-29 22:36:24+00:00,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_806,Positive,2020-05-29

I am not a data scientist or interested in it but i do a bit of data analysis in my field of learning and development. I primarily use R and I would encourage people not to shy away from R. It's different from pythion because it is a domain specific language while python is a general purpose language. R has some great packages such as the Tidyverse which allows very easy exploration of data.

"Liking this Review series!  Absolutely agree with you at 14:38 that tree-based methods may be useful for giving feature importance but the lack of direction in which the features influences the model render it less useful than that of linear model's regression coefficients. Recently, I have been experimenting with the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) library (https://github.com/slundberg/shap) and it is filling this need by also giving the direction at which the feature influences the base values along with the magnitude as in linear models, and the great thing is that it works on nearly all ML algorithms too (tree-based included).",Ugzy0NIB0mdhFmKaX-d4AaABAg,1,3,2020-05-25 15:03:36+00:00,HJH0gfY6EUg,user_1178,Positive,2020-05-25

Just a small question, im currently an industrial engineering student (so i have a good background in statistics) and have enrolled in the EDX IBM data science certificate program. I have finished all the courses (excpet for the SQL one which i will start soon) and feel like im fine with the coding and concepts (regressions, clustering, classification, etc. ) but do not know where to go from here since i have only worked on 1 project (the capstone from the course). As a next step i am thinking of learning tableau (for data visualization) and SQL, but apart from that what do you suggest i do ?

I have no programming foundations so I'm doing basic programing course videos in YouTube, trying to get the best foundations thru free and low cost courses since  I can't afford going to college at this moment.

Is there any basic statistics course you would recommend to give me more idea about the analytics?

"Hello!

Just wanted to throw this out there. I am 27 with a degree in Finance and a real passion for technology/programming. I was a comp sci major in community college, but didn't give it the time it needed and eventually switched to finance. I quickly realized that I wanted to do something that I was passionate about which is numbers and programming. I found data science. So far on my journey, I have acquired a Certificate in Data Science from UCI (very high-level stuff, didn't really go into great depths, mostly theory), but I always have these doubts that I am too old to get into tech or that I don't have enough real world experience to get into tech.

I think your advice really is valuable even to people outside the US, even though of course the formalities may differ, f.e. in Europe it is much more common (or even expected) to include a personal photo on the resume, but I think that the essence of interviews and what recruiters look for is generally the same across the countries, especially for larger companies like FANG etc. I think the interview process does not differ much.

"Hi,

I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I've been out of college for about 2.5 years now and have recently made the decision to switch to Data Science. I have a decent level of programming experience from my time in college/work with Matlab and C++.

And I'm trying to figure out what the best path to this would be for me? I'm not really in a position to stop working, but my company will pay for me to go back to school up to 10k per year for graduate programs or 5k per year for certifications.

I always struggle with numbers, even now I miss the most common and simple operations. 

I'm doing a statistics course in Khan Academy to catch up as fast as I can. But still freak out about it.

"I have become very confused with the different advice various people give regarding data science. The coding languages like R and python seem to give the user a more technical and intricate level of work but these don't seem inviting to me when there are options like Matlab available which is significantly more user friendly especially for beginners. I graduated with an engineering degree last year, I have since tried to study machine learning with python after having no background in the language and it seemed more difficult to study and memorize all the different algorithms one has to go and create or the the different uses of packages like numpy. On the other hand I started a course on data science with MATLAB and the ease of graphing and using visual aids seemed to make Matlab a more desirable choice for me. That being said, I don't really hear of Matlab being a buzz-word in the data science community, why is this? Where would Matlab be more applicable than software languages like python or R?",Ugzz7GhZ0uOn2gd8vVh4AaABAg,1,0,2020-05-18 20:58:39+00:00,4OZip0cgOho,user_4620,Positive,2020-05-18

"Hello, Ken. Regarding the applicability of your advices outside the US, I can speak about Brazil (my home country) and France (the country I currently live). Basically, everything you said so far applies equally to both places, specially regarding the number of pages in the CV. I've been working with engineering for some time now, and in Brazil I see a certain tendency of giving more importance to soft skills than to technical skills, at least in my area. The idea is that you can teach somebody how to program, for example, but it's really hard to teach someone how to have be a good team player. Watching youtube videos about data science I have the impression that on the US the job interviews focus a lot on asking technical questions, but I'm not sure if it's the same through all types of jobs.",Ugxemf8WQ1cT59I8Yn14AaABAg,1,1,2020-05-18 19:05:08+00:00,_K6cNdgN3CI,user_2641,Positive,2020-05-18

Very cool analysis.  I wonder if you could get the data on strikeouts.  I remember seeing some discussion that the Astros' team strikeout % was significantly lower than the MLB average.  If that is the case, then that would give them an advantage in a number of ways - strikeouts are a key metric for pitchers, especially in high leverage late-game situations.

"Best advice from a data scientist: 1) nothing is what it seems. If you have yet to enter the data science and analyst field (still in school or studying), what you think a data scientist is day to day is wrong. So keep an open mind. We’re not writing algorithms on the windows of dorm rooms. Hint: 90% of our work is research and data preparation/cleaning. If you want to be a kick ass data scientist, learn how to interview data users. Coding is the easy part. 

2) did I say be open minded? Good. Now tell yourself over and over and over, “almost no companies know what data science is”. And neither do you. So let me tell you what data science is: it’s the ability to understand and manipulate data and/or information. That’s it. Data science is not Python. If I give you an excel sheet of data and ask you to create a pivot that shows me counts and sums of those counts and you do that; you are being a data scientist. Your ability to code in a certain language does not = data science. I’m telling you this, cause being and looking this internet conceived data scientist part/person is a misconception and can kill your dream of ever growing into a great data scientist. Give yourself credit for what you know. And be confident that because you can analyze data in excel, you can also learn object oriented programming. 

3) nothing is what it seems. Just cause a job title doesn’t say data scientist doesn’t mean your not going to do data science work. I’m a business intelligence developer. I manage data from Oracle, SQL Server and Cloud data lakes. When I sit down at my desk, I open Dbeaver, SQL Server,  Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook. All these IDE’s get used daily. That means I coding in 3 languages at a minimum daily. ONLY ONE of those languages is Python. 

My job title is NOT data scientist. 

My point in all my rubbish talk is that data science is a lot like the cloud. Over 10 years ago, the cloud concept became the rage. And yet most companies are still struggling to implement or even leverage the cloud. Data science is sadly going down that path too. Most companies and their managers are posting jobs to hire data scientists and as long as the job posting has a requirement of “must know Python”, it’s a data scientist job posting. However, 99% of the managers hiring data scientist don’t know what a data scientist is themselves. And those managers couldn’t tell you what a Jupyter notebook is. Or how to write/print  “hello world” in Python. Yet they’re interviewing candidates for Python development. 😁

If and when you enter the so called data scientist career path, be open minded. This is a journey not a goal. Enjoy the trip. Be flexible. Knowledge trumps job titles. If you want to get paid the big bucks, be the most valuable player. That means work on everything sent your way. And show off your skills. 

Good luck!",Ugzb1fCulqpJm9blNmV4AaABAg,1,1,2020-05-17 14:05:21+00:00,4OZip0cgOho,user_2886,Positive,2020-05-17

"Hi Ken, thank you for the great video! As a four-year experience data/risk analyst,  I think your suggestion makes a lot of sense. A master degree could be a great choice if I want to move to a data scientist type of role. I wonder if you could share your thought a little bit about  a master in DS vs Stats. My concern is DS programs are relatively new, and maybe most hiring managers are suspicious about the program and expectation of candidates are not established yet, so they would rather choose candidates with stats background. And plus, fundamental knowledge of stat could potential help solving hard core tasks in career later. Could you please share your thought on this please?

"Sir i have couple of problems unrelated to this Video, I am a 3rd year engineering student from India, and planning to go ms in data science in USA after 4th year. 
1.is ms in data science really worth it from current and future of industry persepectie, like I am seeing that some people prefer 2 years of industrial experience over 2 years of masters but I really like ml and want to publish papers in this domain. 
2.Now i have read couple of books on ml and DL but now i am confused whether (a) . to start learning practical application of ML(like I have build a model but what next..... To make my model more interactive and useful, like I don't want to show companies my (.py file), so to solve that problem maybe I should go for MLops(devops + ml) or
(2) .read more research papers, learn new and advance algo and techniques which no books or course teaches u, start doing competition and maybe go for writing a research paper which would be very helpful for my  ms admission in good college.
Can u help, like any advice would help a lot on what should my direction of working after gaining so much knowledge but have very little practical knowledge of impelnting.

"Hi Ken,
I have a question for you: I'm studying social sciences at the moment with a specialization in quantitative data analysis. We're not just doing basic stuff, I already did courses on geodata analysis, network analysis (even did an analysis of Twitter communities with data that I scraped with the Twitter rest API), multilevel models, structural equation models and causal analysis. But we have no courses on machine learning (actually there would have been a course this semester, but it got dropped because of corona -.- I guess it's too difficult to run a Zoom stream for a guy working with machine learning, idk...). And we also didn't do much on efficient coding / speeding up the code. I'm mostly working with R.
What do you say would be a good next step to get deeper into data science with that pretty solid foundation of knowledge on statistics? Can you recommend courses, books or other sources for my situation? All the data science sources that I found were starting from zero which was a bit annoying for me.

"I am a physics phd student and i also work a full time job, i knew programming would be someting i will love and master since we first got introduced to pascal 7 years ago and matlab and fortran later( that's all we learned, but it gave me the basics) , so now i want to learn Data science for my phd work ( i could just use a software that everyone else use at the lab to analyse and visualise my experimental data) and also to have a job as a DS too, it's perfect now with the quarantine i have more then enough time to learn.

So, do you think i can learn DS in 3 months?i learned python the last two weeks it's easy but i didn't build any projects yet.

"Hello ken! New subscriber here.
My current situation is that i've graduated with a Honours in Biochemistry and last year i enrolled into another undergraduate degree in Computer Science because I figured I would switch my career in hopes of finding a job. After completing my 1.5 years, I've decided to take on a Data science course on udemy and has since created 3 personal data science projects. Do you think that's good enough and that I should apply for jobs or should I just finish my Comp sci undergrad.

"I'm in Ireland so the set up is a little different but my original degree was in social science and now I'm doing a higher diploma in Data Science.  This is a post grad qualification that is an add on to your degree but it's not quite a masters either.  Personally I'm coinciding that with different online courses or certificates.  The diploma is  two years part time and it is designed for people with no data science background so there is a lot to cram in. Naturally there will be area's that i'm weaker in or where the diploma does not go into detail as I would like so I use certificates  to fill those gaps.  Mid term term breaks, winter breaks and soon summer breaks are a good time to do these when lectures are no longer running and you've finished up exams.  In saying that university education in Ireland is  a lot cheaper.  My first degree was free and this higher diploma is around 4000 euro in total so I don't mind spending an extra little bit to do some courses in my own time.",UgwrgwCrhQ5cPAk3lih4AaABAg,3,1,2020-05-12 12:55:36+00:00,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_4311,Positive,2020-05-12

Great video, you gained a subscriber here.
I like more books rather than videos but I will definitely try kagel.

Practical Statistics for Data Science; (read)
R for Data Science; (read)
Introduction to Statistical Learning with R; (read)
Elements of Statistical Learning; (on it)
Advanced R; (next)


Any books you recommend to fill some gaps here?

"Hey Ken, thanks for the video. I have a question I hope you could help me answer. I have a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree, and I would love to transition to the field of Data Science. I am planning to do that by enrolling into the Masters Program. Another reason why I want to get the Masters is because I am planning to immigrate into another country, so getting a degree there would be one of the best options for me, as I can't get a job in DS right away. During my university years, I've been introduced to most of the basic concepts of Statistics and Calculus. I've completed a few DS courses online together with some CS and Programming Extension courses. My question is, do you think getting a Masters degree in Data Science is suitable for me, and what are the chances of me getting accepted into the program?

That aside the system for my academic calendar doesn’t do much to support good self study so I’m still a beginner at everything although I’ve been doing fairly well with my assignments. This makes it hard for me to present myself to companies because immediately they see you’re about to be a graduate with an Msc. in data science, they expect the most from you which is fair but then to someone like me who had zero background in this course before starting, it is quite intimidating.

I notice it personally as well, once you have 90% of the project finished the last 10% can sometimes be the most tedious, even though they are really important.


I just noticed that your channel pretty much blew up after the last video and I want to congratulate you on that! :D
I was definitely sure that you would hit the 10k milestone this year but this was really a good amount quicker than I expected, so congrats to you, that was definitely well deserved!",UgxeWkJFxwFTo9kRGg54AaABAg,1,2,2020-05-11 18:18:32+00:00,jam0xApfC-U,user_830,Positive,2020-05-11

"Hi Ken, thanks for your sql tutorial video, which is very helpful and inspiring!. I have a question in regards to subquery you mentioned in the video.   
select bat.*, pitch.*

inner join (select *
from dbo.Pitching
where W>=10) as pitch
on bat.playerID=pitch.playerID and bat.yearID=pitch.yearID

instead of using subquery in inner join, I use normal inner join and put W>=10 in where clause, which came out the same result:


select bat.*,pitch

inner join dbo.Pitching as pitch

"Hello, Ken. Very nice video, as usual. I've started my Data Science journey a few weeks ago, and I agree with your comments. I'm an engineer and work with computational mechanics for a while now, so I have a quite good understand about algorithms, programming, optimization, and stuff like this. What I figured out is that I already know some stuff about DS, just the terminology I was used to is different, which is great. I have in mind to create my own (much worst) version of scikit-learn, I mean, to implement the major ML algorithms myself, as you suggested. What I think it's also very useful is to create my own cheat sheets and reference notebooks, instead of just using some source already available, because this will force me to think more. Going through the packages' documentations and checking all functions that might be useful can also be a good idea, and this is slightly easier if the person has already some coding experience. I enjoy Coursera courses, and I'm relying on them to build my basic skills, but definitely what will help me most is to write my own codes.

"That new intro of yours does look really cool, I have to say! :D
I agree to the statement that DS has really changed over the past few years.
Because it is such a young field I think that the landscape will change dramatically even for the next 5-10 years.
My personal goal as a (now) first year university student is to stand out amongst my peers,
more than 50% of every CS student seems to be interested in ML, but only a very small percentage of those really
commit to the entire journey, which I really want to do.

"Great video!
Generally I think the younger someone is
(or in general the earlier someone stands in their career/education)
the more impressive extraordinary projects become.
If you're a high school student and you create your own DS project whilst 
collecting own data, that is a lot more impressive than if you're in your final graduate year.
Even though it is never too late to start, I really want to try and make cool
projects early on so that I can build momentum as early as possible.
With the DS market becoming more and more competitive, I think these
uncommon achievements are going to be valued more and more,
especially in larger companies (FANG etc.) where already today

I’ve hosted 1-2 interns every year, and agreed with all your points, particularly the successful interns were those with the skills you’ve mentioned (e.g. R or Python) as well as a GitHub portfoilio of hobby projects (reaffirming their interest and passion for data science). And one of the most important point is to double check that we addressed the potential employer with their name instead of “Dear Sir/Madam”, it goes to show that we have at least personalized the letter to them.

"Hey Ken,
(warning: longer comment incoming)
I've been following you for a few months now and I've been thinking
""Man, I really need to write a comment stating how much I appreciate this channel"",
but I have been putting it of for long enough, this video finally drove me to the keyboard.
It is really inspiring to see you consistently trying to upload informative videos about Data Science
and really giving back to the community. You are a great motivation for me to keep going
and striving towards a career in Data Science (or even Machine Learning Engineering).
I clicked through your social links and noticed that you have a really well documented system
including your GitHub, personal website. Medium posts and this YouTube-Channel.
With a full time job besides all of that it is really impressive to me how you can manage all of these sources
and be so consistent with it. I'd love to have my project reviewed by you, even though at the moment my GitHub
is my least well documented source (xD). But you definitely inspired me to put more time and effort
into polishing personal projects and really not letting loose on those last 20%.
I am almost certain, that within a year or two your channel will become very impactful in the DS community
and that you will see very positive results. Your content is very informative and helping.
If I tried to point out some minor areas of improval it would actually not be based on the content itself, but rather
on aspects surrounding it (such as presentation, background noise, ... ) but I am sure you are aware of this,
recently I have noticed quite some improvement in those areas as well, so all I can say is chapeau!
I am really excited to see how far you will come in the next months, you definitely won me as a loyal fan of yours :)",UgwyHHBJKHrmTL-lH8t4AaABAg,3,4,2020-04-27 16:39:52+00:00,DW55gaQ_Egk,user_830,Positive,2020-04-27

"Hi Ken, Thank you so much for the series and everything you have done so far in this chanel. In case of the series ""Data Science Project from Scratch"", this is something I was looking for. Practical knowladge, without cutting, with using Google if it's necessary. Definitely, you helped me a lot to sort my knowledge and add some interesting tips.

"Hey Ken,
Is it just me that I'm unable to see the salary component on the left-aligned job summary columns. I'm able to see only 1. Company Name, 2. Job Title, 3. Location. Is the Salary estimate not visible on the updated Glassdoor page?
I got '-1' as salary estimate for all jobs. And this is the same URL from Omer Sakariya's code.

"Hey Ken, enjoyed some of your videos. Really enjoy data science have a pretty good background as an IE major. Looking to improve my skills. One concern I have. I got on Kaggle for the first time and I was pretty excited to find these useable data sets to work on some of my data vis skills. Saw they were downloadable zip files and that immediately scared me, but I naively thought everyone else uses it and a quick google search brought up no safety concerns. After downloading about 3 data sets. I am pretty convinced i downloaded some malware. Got multiple warning signs from the browsers I use and then a bunch of random sites jumped up and teamviewer popped open. Immediately shut down and disconnected everything. Is this normal? Do you have any tips for safely downloading data sets etc?? Would really appreciate. Thanks",UgzNeYGTCLhUGkbE2xB4AaABAg,1,1,2020-04-08 06:21:11+00:00,8igH8qZafpo,user_853,Positive,2020-04-08

"Hi Ken, 


Thank you for your advice! This has been very helpful as an aspiring data scientist. I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on this project I am currently working on and if it is good enough to put on my portfolio. To quickly summarize, I did EDA on my Spotify listening history and merged it with a Spotify features dataset that listed features of each song (For example, tempo, major, acousticness, and valence are a couple examples). I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the songs I usually listen to and the features. However, there was very little correlation so I said that the model (using multiple linear regression) I would build would be very inaccurate at predicting, and showed the inaccuracy by building it and finding its mean squared error (which was very large; although there were some predictions that were close). 


In your opinion, would this suffice as a good project? If not, do you have any insight on how I could improve?

"You spent almost half of your presentation talking about Machine learning(feature engineering, clustering, regression etc). In my humble opinion Data science has a lot to do with other aspects other than Machine learning. I realized many people focus a lot on machine learning which shrinks a lot of the aspects of data science. Kaggle, for example, encourages folks to hone their machine learning skills. Kaggle isn't a good place to learn full fledge data science skills. Data collection,  Data Cleaning, Data manipulation, Exploratory Data analyses where all left out. Kaggle mostly brings ready-made datasets which limits many kagglers the ability to effectively develop their data science skills. Nevertheless I sincerely appreciate the value you have provided through your video. Thank you",UgwyiPOnDxWqCkpCI7N4AaABAg,4,2,2020-03-24 23:08:28+00:00,yukdXV9LR48,user_784,Positive,2020-03-24

"Great video as always, but I will say this is a serious understatement.  Now that I'm out of work,  I am ever so glad that I have decided  to pursue this career path. Three great reasons to pursue data science: 1. Do something positive for society and gain a strong sense of purpose. 2. Something to keep the mind stimulated which can greatly help with depression and anxiety. 3. A solid career that can potentially help someone avoid being homeless and going down a dark path.

"As always, great video!


One idea I haven't heard of before is focusing on one project and learning only the specific skills necessary for that project. Everyone's experienced the overwhelm when it comes to beginning the Data Science / ML / DL journey, and we're usually hit with the, ""learn all of statistics, all of programming, and all of math"" mentality that is drilled into our heads. This can be enough to scare people away, and your advice really combats this while touching on the idea of running on passion and things you enjoy by picking a personal project or use case.




It's really cool to see that you have a specific domain that you stay in for projects (sports and sports betting). My question is:


Do you stay within that domain at work?


If you do, do you suggest that we each choose a specific domain as well, and cater towards that when building a career and finding a job?
If you don't, would you agree that it's still valuable to choose a specific domain? Do you think that your experience and expertise in sports / sports betting transfers over to your current job/position?

"What about adding a 2.5-point line a little bit closer to the basket than the current 3-point line (2 feet closer?), that would give a boost to the no-man's land and the now reluctantly taken and often frowned-upon mid-range jumper. And then moving the 3-point line a bit further away. I think this could eventually make the game more interesting. It only takes a bid getting used to 0.5 points; and if you are fouled while attempting a 2.5 point shot, the first time team gets 2 free-throws, next time this happens 3 free throws are rewarded.

"Thanks for this video Ken. I have a sports analytics problem for you. When the 3 point shot was first introduced in the NBA, I said start launching them. Traditionalists said, oh no, too risky, too many will ruin the game. 20+ years later 3 point shots are an integral part of any teams' strategy. OK, my question is regarding the 2 point conversion in football. My belief is that the 2 point conversion should be tried every time. Once a team gets used to it they will develop special teams just for the conversion. Plus, once fully developed, these plays could be used for any regular down inside the 5 yard line. The amount of dedicated plays could be unlimited - 2 QB's on the field, 5 running backs, non-traditional formations, etc. Not to mention how exciting the game would become. Do you have any supporting evidence that, over time, going for the 2 point conversion 100% of the time would pay off? I guess part of your problem is that you cannot measure what hasn't been tried.",UgzbLTvd5RV4dt3l2O94AaABAg,1,1,2020-02-17 15:21:02+00:00,8igH8qZafpo,user_1646,Positive,2020-02-17

"Thank you for this video! I have a nice video suggestion.
How to implement Data Science into a working business?
Let's imagine you have a business that produces refrigerators. One single small factory, a sales team, etc.
I know that Data Science can help make any process more efficient, let it be the energy consumption, the production itself, supply chain, sales, marketing, etc.
What could one do to implement data collection and data analysis in a company like this to analyze data and drive insights to make a business more efficient? What are some real-life examples, software names, etc? What is your related real-life experience?
I don't ask for a whole sophisticated tutorial, the basic overview kind of information would be enough, so a person from a non-technical background could learn how to implement Data Science in business.

"Ken, the 3 point shot means that defenses can no longer help against offensive ball penetration because 3 point shooters have become so expert and are stationed too far away from the basket.  With the increase in dribbling ability along with an increase in athleticism to convert alley-oop dunks so easily, even the 2-0n-2 game has become impossible to stop.  Basketball's offensive/defensive balance has been totally ruined.  Defenses can neither take away the 3 point or 2 point game in today's NBA as the rules are currently set up.  When there was only a 2 point basket, defenses could help on ball penetration and know that a distance shot would not destroy their ability to compete in the game.  Moving the 3 point basket out further only exacerbates this problem by creating more space that a defense has to cover after positioning its resources to defend the 2 point game.  If the defense chooses to shut down the 3 point shooters by staying with them, then the defense is decimated with the 2 point game.

"Great resolutions! Some of my comments:
1) Nice thought, but optimise for what makes sense to YOU, not to some arbitrary set of criteria of what qualifies a ""good code"" by engineers. But obviously if you can't efficiently read/reason about your own code - then improvements are due! Functions/Objets aren't ALWAYS the right way forward, and there are also pros and cons to speed of development VS meeting ""classic"" code standards. Machine Learning is NOT the same as traditional programming, and same measures of quality should not be blindly applied to both.
2) Good thought - but just keep in mind that something that can take a whole evening if you go to an event - can be ""consumed"" at 2x speed on youtube in 40 mins. Events are important for networking and benchmarking yourself against other professionals, but don't have high expectations of actually LEARNING from talks - it's rather inefficient.
3) Github is definitely a place to be. Good README are always appreciated. Please share everything you can - you never know who could benefit from it!
4) Kaggle is amazing platform - it could be very hard to get into their way of thinking (it's like a parallel universe at first), but there is also so much to learn there. Just keep in mind that any particular technology that is state of the art today - might be completely obsolete in a few years time. Approaches to the problem and ways of thinking don't change as often.
5) Best resolution possible! When you do your work truly end-to-end you really learn so much more. I would focus on K8S (that you mentioned earlier) - I think it is the future, and spending time learning AWS or Azure specific ML tools might not be the best investment of your time.


My resolutions:
1) Own my work more end-to-end (same as your 5). Have a say both in how data is collected and presented to the DS team, as well as a say in how the final product looks and feels.  NOT being just a ""cog"" in a chain, but truly understand meaning and impact of my work.
2) Get to a level of Master on Kaggle (same as your 4) if possible, or at least do a few public kernels.
3) Attempt to build side projects which other people who aren't data scientists can interact with (like that pix2pix live demo)
4) Get more certifications and accreditations related to IT and ML
5) Finally get into PyTorch properly and become an expert
6) Improve my ability to read/analyse scientific papers. (So I don't have to wait until some YouTuber reviews them to get an idea about what's going on in our field)
7) Get a grip on Probabilistic Programming - I've been struggling with it for quite some time, and I think I'll be able to make it useful soon!

"Ken, great stuff! Thanks for walking us through your simulation. 

Quick question: the way you calculate the score seems to skew the comparisons if one of the scores is high. 

For example:

If one team score is say 140-139 it averages to approx 140. The other team score is 120-90. It averages 105. So the team that won by 1 gets the win in the sim cause they scored a lot of points. But the other team won by 30 and had a better defense.

Do you see my point?

I'm thinking you ought to subtract and return a margin of victory then compare the margin of victory. Maybe worth running simulations to see how different they are?

Thanks again!",UgxpvhrrXSJM8ZZYv8N4AaABAg,3,2,2019-12-07 20:51:34+00:00,irjTWNV0eAY,user_2153,Positive,2019-12-07

In all honesty, I would be quite content with a data analyst role. I would see it as a stepping stone and an opportunity to improve in all areas in life.

"Your advice is spot on:
 1. be prepared to put a lot of time and effort into learning (in truth, the learning never stops. 😁)
 2. be proactive about finding problems and solving them (plus, keep in mind there's a difference between asking for help because you're truly stuck vs. asking for help because you're too lazy to figure out how to solve a problem. Data scientists are supposed to be really good at problem solving. Being a data scientist who's asking for help all the time kind of undermines the purpose of being a data scientist. 😉
 3. learn the math (I actually believe that most people have the ability to understand the math but, most have been taught math in a way that's not relevant enough nor interesting enough to them. When done right, I can't see how anyone can not love math.)
4. learn coding
5. tell great stories

"Hey Ken,  I have a few data science projects(python/sql) that i'm working on while taking edx classes but also work full-time as mech engineer trying to switch careers. The emphasis on masters seems to be quite apparent among DS jobs especially in Cali. 


If I want to go through masters in cs, i would have to be part-time(financial reasons) but also put all my projects on hold due to time constraint. It would take roughly 1 year for me to get around solid 4-5 projects to complete but 2.5 years for my masters.


What are your thoughts about this? going the personal project route or masters route? I wish I can do both but that is a recipe for a burnout. I enjoy the technicality of DS and want to get into the industry asap.

"Hey PSA (maybe pin this or comment this yourself) but 1.2.0 as of right now doesn't really work. It's query_tweets is broken and you're going to have to specifically install 1.1.0 (pip install twitterscraper==1.1.0) in order to use it. 


Also, for anyone wondering about performance issues and harvesting tons of tweets, make use of the poolsize parameter. Poolsize controls the number of parallel scrapers you can have up at a single time. At maximum you can have one scraper per day. So for example, if you are scraping a period of 30 days, you can use poolsize=30 to get 30 parallel scrapers running at a time. If you want to harvest over a big time frame, try to harvest smaller time periods and loop through dates manually (otherwise your CPU, RAM, and internet usage will shoot through the roof). That should give you the best mix of performance and speed.",UgyUymUKeY7nfgJ8eYZ4AaABAg,3,2,2019-07-25 18:46:10+00:00,zF_Q2v_9zKY,user_758,Positive,2019-07-25

"Hello everyone! Dan, one of my followers, pointed out that in this analysis I actually included the dependent variable (minutes played) many of the methods that I tested. Obviously, this is not something that you should do. After re-running the analysis with the correct adjustments made, these were my findings.


Just Previous Game Prediction Score:  7.991422567954051
Previous Three Games Rolling Avg. Score:  6.937990350926065
Previous Five Games Rolling Avg. Score:  6.82599267659377
Previous Ten Games Rolling Avg. Score:  6.872496732886791
Previous Three Games Rolling Median Score:  7.233177023501123
Previous Five Games Rolling Median Score:  7.111145383454696
Previous Ten Games Rolling Median Score:  7.079332689005398


It looks like the past 5 game rolling average is actually the best performing of this group. 


Linear Model Performance: RMSE =  6.3429443807711765
Random Forest Performance: RMSE =  6.284779430662026
Combined Model Performance: RMSE = 6.276509665369035

As expected, the ensemble model performs the best. It appears that adding the linear component does provide a small amount of lift to the results.
